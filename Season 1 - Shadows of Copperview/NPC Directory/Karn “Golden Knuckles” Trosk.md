## One-Line Summary  
A showman warlord turned civic overlord, Karn masks brutality behind gold, charm, and a city-sized debt ledger.

---

## Personality  
- Public Persona: Charismatic, paternal, well-dressed. Smiles too wide. Laughs at his own stories.  
- True Core: Sadistic strategist who thrives on leverage. Believes in power through ownership—of systems, people, and consequences.  
- Speech Style: Casual faux-wisdom littered with threats. Always speaking as if the listener already agreed.  

> “Y’see, every fire needs a match. I just make sure it burns in the right district.”  
> “I don’t own Copperview. She just owes me everything.”

## Physical Description  
- Stocky, heavily built goblin with golden prosthetic knuckles engraved with factional debts.  
- Wears a trench-length velvet coat lined in copper filigree. His boots are too shiny.  
- Gold rings on every finger—each one looted from a rival or traitor.  
- Smells like cigar smoke, gun oil, and expensive regret.

---

## Background  
- Rose from [[The Crucible]] pit fights, once known only as "Knucks."  
- Survived a public assassination, returned weeks later with a golden jaw brace and full backing from The Grip.  
- Personally negotiated the deals that turned Lockjaw from street muscle into a governing syndicate.  
- Built the “favor economy” now driving Copperview’s internal collapse.

---

## Goals & Motivations  
- Maintain Lockjaw’s supremacy—not just through power, but permanence.  
- Dismantle hope in rival factions by making them complicit in their own failure.  
- Ensure Copperview remembers him as the one who kept it from falling apart.  
- Groom the next generation of Lockjaw to obey—not to innovate.

---

## Secrets & Hooks  
- Keeps a hidden vault, the Black Binder, filled with confession recordings, ledgers, and blackmail spanning every major faction.  
- Is suspected of personally funding the Loose Teeth to bait traitors inside Lockjaw.  
- Maintains an off-grid kill team known only as The Receipts.  
- Rumors claim his golden knuckles are fused to cursed debt-tokens—the more he collects, the more he loses sleep.

---

## Combat Role (Teaser)  
- Mid-to-late campaign boss.  
- Leverages terrain, crowd control, and brutal strikes.  
- Calls in favors mid-fight: crowd suppression, hired "audience," or even legal override mid-combat ("This fight is now a city-sanctioned arbitration.")  
- Fight takes place in a council chamber turned fighting pit, where every policy passed becomes a phase change.

---

## Abilities (Narrative/Mechanical Seeds)  
- Golden Knuckle Slam – Slams the ground, cracking copper-veined stone and stunning targets.  
- Debtor’s Chain – Calls out a name and pulls them into a forced grapple with ghostly gold chains.  
- “You Work for Me Now” – Coerces low-Will enemies to fight for him using a declared “favor owed.”  
- Collateral Clause – When dropped below half HP, he triggers a “contract clause” to detonate part of the environment to deny safe space.

---

## Social and Political Encounters  
- In debates, Karn wins not with logic—but by offering dirty truths.  
- Has a habit of making enemies laugh before making them disappear.  
- Loves to “invite” rivals to dinner and spend three hours praising them before revealing the trap.  
- Can flip party NPC allies to his side if they value survival over principle.

---

## Encounter Hooks  
- A forged permit in the players’ possession ties back to Karn’s signature—putting them in his debt.  
- A captured informant offers to reveal Karn’s vault location—if they live long enough.  
- Karn gives a public address while the party investigates him—forcing a choice: ambush now, or gather more dirt?  
- A rival faction asks for help removing Karn—only to be another Lockjaw puppet in disguise.
