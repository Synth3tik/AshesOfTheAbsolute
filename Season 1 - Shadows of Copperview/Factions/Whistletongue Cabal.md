## Type  
Clandestine intelligence broker guild / distributed information cartel

## Location / Region  
Mirage Rise (primarily)  
Known to have ears in every tier, but no confirmed headquarters

## Theme & Aesthetic  
The Whistletongue Cabal is a **phantom faction**—a hidden network of information traders, double-agents, narrative saboteurs, and “memory editors” that operate behind gossip columns, urban myths, and coded side-eyes. They have no office, no sign, no business cards. But if you’ve heard something strange, dangerous, or *useful*... odds are it passed through a Whistletongue.

They do not announce themselves. They **don’t accept clients**. They accept **recommendations**. They don't wear uniforms. They wear other people.

## Philosophy & Goals  
- **Belief:** Information is the only real weapon. The louder the truth, the easier it is to bury the useful parts.  
- **Short-Term:** Spread “controlled instability” by feeding truths to the right people at the wrong time.  
- **Long-Term:** Remain above the board—never named, never blamed, never caught. Become the city’s subconscious.  
- **Self-View:** Custodians of insight, sowers of calibrated chaos, curators of necessary poison.  
- **Outsider View:** Dangerous rumor-mongers who manipulate people for sport, money, or ideology—depending on who’s asking.

## Key Figures  
(None confirmed. All names possibly aliases.)
- **“Glasslace”** – Said to be the editor of five fake newspapers and one real one. Believed to be dead, or multiple people.  
- **“Salt Whisper”** – Whispers public secrets from crowded balconies. Always a different voice. Possibly a title.  
- **“Moss Cut”** – Reported to be the Cabal’s archivist. Collects ruinous truths in fungus-coded walls deep in the Rustfloor.

## Influence & Operations  
- Operates through **untraceable proxies**—whispers, scandal scrolls, overheard dreams, suspiciously accurate rumors.  
- Offers “**whisper packages**”—information packets sold at exorbitant cost, often wrapped in red-stamped parchment and only accessible via coded phrase and vouch-sign.  
- Has no storefront or fixed contact method. Access is only gained via **multi-faction recommendation**, or by performing a deed that earns their attention.  
- Known for leaking truths in parts—never whole—ensuring the client becomes dependent on context they don’t have.  
- May embed agents inside other factions—not as spies, but as **story-shapers**. Narrative janitors.

## Player Relationship  
- **Early:** The party hears rumors of a “voice broker” behind multiple major leaks. An NPC contact mentions a name that shouldn’t exist.  
- **Mid:** The party receives a “package” they didn’t ask for—truth they didn’t want, leading to options they didn’t expect.  
- **Late:** The party either strikes a dangerous bargain to receive game-changing truth—or finds out one of them has been used as a Whistletongue relay all along.

## Known Tactics  
- **Controlled Truth Leaks:** Carefully timed drops that destabilize rival factions without implicating the source.  
- **Echo Rumors:** Spread conflicting narratives through dozens of minor actors to mask the truth within static.  
- **Backspeak Traps:** Plant secrets inside conversations with pre-coded phrases that activate memory edits or ideological triggers.  
- **Information Indebtedness:** Use partial truths to hook clients into dependency, then escalate offers based on desperation.

## Rumors & Hooks  
- The **Salt Whisper** was overheard speaking in two voices at once—one human, one construct.  
- Someone claiming to be Whistletongue handed a party contact **a file on a crime not yet committed.**  
- The **University of Lyssari** once tried to expose the Cabal. The entire board now suffers from “deliberate misremembering.”  
- **Lockjaw denies they exist**—but Ledger has a whole wing called “Cabal Contingency Archives.”

## Symbolism  
- **No official symbol.** However:  
  - Some believe a **cut tongue icon** drawn in water on stone marks a Whistletongue drop point.  
  - “Double-dot” ink smears on sealed letters may indicate Cabal message interception.  
  - Others believe **they wear no mark because their presence is never questioned.**  

- **Sayings (Never spoken aloud):**  
  - “Truth spreads. Lies echo. We hum.”  
  - “You already heard us.”  
  - “It wasn’t gossip. It was an offer.”
