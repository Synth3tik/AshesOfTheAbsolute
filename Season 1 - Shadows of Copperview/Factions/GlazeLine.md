## Type  
Influence cartel / virality cult / reputation control syndicate

## Location / Region  
Pinnacle Row (primary), with echo-reach into Mirage Rise via trend parasitism

## Theme & Aesthetic  
**Glazeline** controls Copperview’s cultural bloodstream. They are content queens, image warlords, bimbo-coded influencers with trend-algorithms stitched into their neural lace. But beneath the filters, the glamor, and the synthetic eyelashes lies a flammable foundation—**clout as a weapon**, **attention as control**, and **beauty as burn bait**.

Their headquarters, **The Mirrordome**, is a high-altitude light sculpture where every surface reflects someone prettier than you. It is part fashion lab, part content cathedral, part data-fortress. The air smells like burnt sugar and sponsored pheromones.

## Philosophy & Goals  
- **Belief:** If people can see you, they can believe you. And belief shapes reality.  
- **Short-Term:** Dominate the perception layer of high society—set trends, erase reputations, gatekeep status.  
- **Long-Term:** Replace governance with curated popularity. If everyone wants to be you, you don’t need laws.  
- **Self-View:** Cultural curators. Gods of relevance. Protectors of the beautiful lie.  
- **Outsider View:** Narcissistic tyrants in glitter. They don’t rule with swords. They cancel with sparkles.

## Key Figures  
- **Valis Blume** – CEO-Model. Face of Glazeline. Never speaks on record, communicates entirely through social reaction and facial gesture interface. Allegedly non-biological at this point.  
- **Glori-Lux** – Trend tactician. Specializes in “cancellation choreography” and viral warfare. Rebooted her brand three times last month.  
- **HoloGirlz** – Augmented glam-clone stream crew. A distributed persona that hosts, records, and distorts live events into monetized narratives.

## Influence & Operations  
- Maintains **Clout Scores**, which determine eligibility for events, sponsorships, even legal access in parts of Pinnacle.  
- Operates **stream nodes** and **storyloops** that reshape player reputations in real time.  
- Owns “**Face Rights**” to over a thousand influential goblins, licensing their likeness for propaganda.  
- Hosts **Clarity Trials**—viral events where rising figures are judged by aesthetic performance and narrative arc integrity.  
- Can **erase individuals from media**, removing them from search, mention, and influence structures citywide.

## Player Relationship  
- **Early:** The party must rise above irrelevance—Glazeline may offer “starter packages” (gear, contracts, followers) with invisible strings.  
- **Mid:** Players find themselves part of a curated arc: rivalries, romances, or betrayals *they didn’t plan for.*  
- **Late:** Glazeline begins using the party to steer public narrative, building them into tools—or threats—that must be rewritten or removed.

## Known Tactics  
- **Aesthetic Obliteration:** Target someone’s look, brand, and platform until they disappear socially—then economically.  
- **Trend Hijack:** Mimic uprising aesthetics and movements, sell them as products, and destroy the original credibility.  
- **Narrative Sculpting:** Rewrite personal histories through micro-content campaigns and curated gossip trails.  
- **Influence Debt:** Sponsorships come with clauses—if you stop trending the way they want, your privileges vanish.

## Rumors & Hooks  
- Valis Blume hasn’t aged in two decades—and some say they were never “born” in the first place.  
- A content creator recently disappeared—*and no one remembers they existed.*  
- A Glazeline-exclusive Clarity Trial is being planned with a death clause hidden in the brand contract.  
- A leaked memo implies they’re working with Lockjaw to create a “reputation-based legal tier.”

## Symbolism  
- **Primary Icon:** A stylized drop of gloss over a mirror ring—both reflecting and distorting.  
- **Style Cues:** Pastel latex, crystal-studded neural lenses, mood-matching skin gloss, personal scent halos.  
- **Slogans:**  
  - “Shine first. Burn later.”  
  - “We curate what’s real.”  
  - “Flammable, filtered, flawless.”
