## Type  
Black-market emotion engineering syndicate / chemical augmentation cartel

## Location / Region  
Pinnacle Row (flagship clinics)  
Hidden clinics scattered in Crownspire resorts and private estates

## Theme & Aesthetic  
Coiled Bloom doesn’t sell drugs. They sell **emotional restructuring**—surgical empathy, precision grief, synthetic joy engineered for performance. They are **neural ripperdocs for the elite**, run out of sterile chrome labs dressed up like spas. Their tools are scalpels and dopamine keys. Their clients are kings and killers.

The Dream Suite isn’t a pleasure tower. It’s a clinic where your mind is taken apart, scrubbed, and put back together *more beautiful*. And more useful.

## Philosophy & Goals  
- **Belief:** Emotion is a system. Like any system, it can be upgraded—or deleted.  
- **Short-Term:** Expand control over emotional calibration for Pinnacle elites—politicians, tacticians, ideologues.  
- **Long-Term:** Replace moral development with chemical tuning. If everyone feels the right thing, no one asks questions.  
- **Self-View:** Surgeons of the soul. We don’t change you—we perfect you.  
- **Outsider View:** Drug-dealing cult-clinics running psychological wet work with a scent diffuser.

## Key Figures  
- **Arix Val Bloom** – Founder-patient. Still seen occasionally in public, but deeply altered. May no longer control their own actions.  
- **Silla Frame** – Lead neural engineer and somatic surgeon. Known for finishing brainwork with “a kiss and a flick of lavender.”  
- **The Orchid Tier** – A private client list of high-value individuals who’ve had full emotional architecture rewrites.

## Influence & Operations  
- Runs private **emotion-clinics** outfitted with neuromod beds, stim-chambers, and memory-pulse interfaces.  
- Offers **personality surgeries**—removal of guilt, amplification of confidence, or complete emotional resets.  
- Provides designer drugs through **neural slot cartridges**, **biografted glands**, and **customized wet-ware injection ports**.  
- The **Bloomguard** act as security and living test subjects—emotionally controlled enforcers with fine-tuned response patterns.

## Player Relationship  
- **Early:** Offered “stabilization” treatments after trauma or political tension. Seemingly generous.  
- **Mid:** An NPC undergoes a full emotional rewrite and now behaves like someone else—but better.  
- **Late:** The party learns Bloom has been rewriting public figures en masse, engineering mood-compliant governance through chemical consent.

## Known Tactics  
- **Surgical Compliance:** Emotional loyalty implants that respond to stress with chemically-induced obedience.  
- **Weaponized Grief:** Induce mournful states in enemies, reducing their ability to act, lead, or resist.  
- **Joy Conditioning:** Create neuro-associations between Bloom loyalty and personal success.  
- **Memory Dilation:** Stretch or compress timelines to make truths easier—or harder—to remember.

## Rumors & Hooks  
- Silla Frame once bragged she could rebuild a conscience in under 90 seconds—but only if she made it smaller.  
- Arix Val Bloom is said to have died—but their neural shell still smiles.  
- One Bloom clinic beneath Crownspire reportedly erased an entire noble house’s blood feud in a single night.  
- A prototype memory filter was stolen and implanted in a minor political figure. Now they believe they’ve always been loyal to Bloom.

## Symbolism  
- **Primary Icon:** A stylized flower blooming from a neural jackport.  
- **Style Cues:** Bio-thread robes, face tattoos shaped like blooming scars, emotion-regulating piercings, scent collars.  
- **Slogans:**  
  - “You don’t feel pain. You feel progress.”  
  - “Precision joy. Clinical loyalty.”  
  - “We bloom what was broken.”
