These factions operate in the shadow of Lockjaw's influence. Each has its own philosophy, schemes, and fatal flaws—making them perfect allies, threats, or powder kegs for the party to ignite.

## [[Coil-Eaters]] (Coilys, coil-eaters)

- **Region:** Rustfloor (primarily), with fragmented presence in lower Crucible and sublevels  
- **Theme:** Conspiracy cult fractured by ideology  
- **Vibe:** Broken signal paranoia; mad prophets whispering truth through static  
- **Description:**  
  A scattered, half-mocking name for a loose network of truth-seekers, paranoid engineers, and ideology-sick heretics. The Coil-Eaters believe Copperview is built on a lie—one encoded in infrastructure, murders, and looped systems of thought. Most think they’re just junk-addled doomsayers howling at shadows, but some of their predictions have come disturbingly true. They speak in fragments, dream in patterns, and leave symbols behind like breadcrumbs toward a buried truth the city refuses to see.  
- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:** Ignored publicly, tracked privately. Lockjaw deems them a non-threat, but too many Coil-Eater symbols have appeared near high-value sabotage to dismiss entirely. Some whisper that the Coil-Eaters and Lockjaw share the same infection—just different strains.

## [[Rustblood Kin]]

- **Region:** Rustfloor  
- **Theme:** Tech-shamanism and ancestral reclamation  
- **Vibe:** Brutal, fractured scrapyard cults who speak through steel and blood  
- **Description:**  
  The Rustblood Kin are a scattered network of goblin war-clans, scavenger tribes, and scrap-priests who claim descent from Copperview’s first miners and forge-builders. They believe the city's soul lives in rust, oil, and bone-deep vibration—and that true goblin heritage has been buried by the upward-climbing greed of the surface. Each Kin clan maintains its own rites, relics, and territory, fiercely independent and often violently hostile even to each other.  

  They rule the Rustfloor not by law, but by sheer endurance. No other faction can hold ground there for long without facing retaliatory raids, sabotage ambushes, or ritualized combat trials. Their culture is brutal, half-mystic and half-animal, but deeply reverent. To them, every gear is sacred if it’s older than memory. Every spark is a whisper from the past.

  Inter-clan warfare is common, but outsiders unify them fast. And when the Kin march in unison, cities burn.
- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  The Kin call them “The Forged Liars.” Lockjaw represents everything they despise—order without spirit, structure without root. Skirmishes flare when Lockjaw attempts to reinforce infrastructure in the Rustfloor or reclaim old tech. But a full-scale purge has never succeeded. The Kin always return from the pipes, one torch and blade at a time.

## [[Iron Loop]]

- **Region:** The Crucible, Winding Descent  
- **Theme:** Rail union turned freight mafia  
- **Vibe:** Grease-stained enforcers with ledgers, pipewrenches, and mobile offices  
- **Description:**  
  Born from an old freight union, the Iron Loop now operates as Copperview’s most powerful logistics cartel. They control all major transit—trains, cargo lifts, migrant checkpoints—and their word decides what moves and who doesn’t. Every shipment, every access route, and every safe passage is a toll opportunity, and their reach extends deep into the Rustfloor and beyond.  

  While officially structured around permits and routes, the Loop functions more like a moving city-state. Their armored trains serve as bunkhouses, mobile council chambers, and weapons platforms. Split between the bureaucratic Burnside Ledger and the muscle-bound Knuckle Railers, the faction constantly teeters between organized syndicate and rolling civil dispute.  

  Most of the city sees them as essential. Everyone else knows they're just *waiting* to see what happens when the Loop decides to stop the flow.  

- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  A tense alliance. Lockjaw relies on the Loop’s transport monopoly but constantly works to fracture their unity. So far, the Loop has resisted every attempt at full assimilation—because when the rails stop, *everything* stops.

---

## [[Fracture Union]]

- **Region:** The Crucible (formerly widespread; now fractured and hunted)  
- **Theme:** Anti-verticalist insurgents  
- **Vibe:** Scaffold-wrecking engineers turned ideological saboteurs  
- **Description:**  
  Once a rising labor movement of lift crews and construction workers, the Fracture Union now exists in scattered cells, dismantling the city’s vertical hierarchy—literally. They believe elevation itself is oppression, and that Copperview must be brought to a single, equal level. Known for collapsing stairways, sabotaging lifts, and rigging “symbolic demolitions,” they’ve become a go-to scapegoat for instability.  
- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:** Officially condemned, unofficially convenient. Lockjaw has crushed their leadership, but their name lingers like a threat. They’re the perfect villains for a problem Lockjaw doesn't want traced too close to home.


---

## [[Ashvial Syndicate]]

- **Region:** The Crucible and Mirage Rise  
- **Theme:** Alchemical forgers and black-market bureaucrats  
- **Vibe:** Illicit pharmacy meets counterfeit licensing office  
- **Description:**  
  A decentralized but alarmingly professional network of chemical smugglers, forged permit dealers, and backroom fixers posing as a civic logistics agency. The Ashvial Syndicate presents itself as a "supply coordination bureau"—and technically, it is. But what they supply includes off-the-books identities, transmuted goods, forbidden reagents, and fabricated city credentials.  

  Their members are known for their sterile coats, copper-plated gloves, and obsession with process. Transactions are ritualized. Paperwork is *always* filed—whether real or fabricated.  
- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  Lockjaw tolerates Ashvial because they grease the city’s hidden gears. Some believe Ashvial supplies Lockjaw with deniable solutions—others think they’re the only faction Lockjaw hasn’t figured out how to tax. Either way, no one questions their seals… because they can’t afford to find out which ones are real.

---
## [[Hollow Deck]]

- **Region:** The Crucible, Mirage Rise, Pinnacle Row  
- **Theme:** Multi-tiered gambling cartel and risk manipulation syndicate  
- **Vibe:** Velvet-cloaked casinos, rigged odds, and golden contracts with invisible ink  
- **Description:**  
  A sprawling gambling and finance empire with a different face on every floor. In the Crucible, the Hollow Deck runs smoky dice dens and debt-fueled street games. In Mirage Rise, they operate lavish casino towers and discreet credit networks. In Pinnacle Row, they host “philosophical gaming salons” where fortunes shift over wine and whispered leverage.  

  To outsiders, they sell entertainment and excitement. In truth, they manage **risk itself**—controlling fortunes, generating debt, and turning bets into lifelong contracts. To play is to be seen. To owe is to belong.  

- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  Technically unaffiliated. In practice, their power is complementary—Lockjaw runs the systems; the Hollow Deck ensures everyone keeps gambling inside them. Some say the two haven’t fought because they already share the same table.


---

## [[Ledger Court]]

- **Region:** Mirage Rise  
- **Theme:** Contractual dominators of commerce  
- **Vibe:** Debt cult meets civic law office, run by black-robed accountants who fear nothing but imbalance  
- **Description:**  
  The Ledger Court rules over contracts like clergy over scripture. They control credit lines, resolve economic disputes, and manipulate enforcement through tightly worded clauses and slow, inevitable litigation. Clad in silk-ink robes bearing clauses in fading gold, they preside from tower-chambers stacked with ledgers that hum with bound intent.  

  The Court doesn’t believe in power through force—they believe in **interest**, **collateral**, and **inevitability**. Their worldview is simple: all debts are honored eventually. Even if it takes generations.  

  Their Coinhawks are enforcers of “final clauses,” bounty-binders licensed to collect, repossess, or execute by contract law.  

- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  Public allies, private predators. Lockjaw enforces order; the Court *owns it.* Neither faction has moved openly—but both know only one ledger will be balanced at the top.


---

## [[Whistletongue Cabal]]

- **Region:** Mirage Rise (allegedly)  
- **Theme:** Clandestine information brokers  
- **Vibe:** Disguised intelligence guild woven into gossip, scandal, and misremembered truths  
- **Description:**  
  The Whistletongue Cabal is a ghost-story turned real—a decentralized information cartel that trades in secrets, destabilizes factions, and rewrites narratives. They have no storefront, no confirmed leaders, and no official existence. Access is invitation-only, and even their clients rarely know who they’re dealing with. Their “whisper packages” are known to topple careers, erase identities, or ignite factional war with nothing but a sentence.

  No one admits to working for them. No one can afford to ignore them.

- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  Lockjaw refuses to acknowledge them. The Ledger Court, on the other hand, keeps entire archives tracking whispers attributed to them. If the Cabal is real, they're the only faction that answers to no power—because they *control* what powers know.


---

## [[Crownspire Trust]]

- **Region:** Pinnacle Row  
- **Theme:** Leisure-lords and civic luxury barons  
- **Vibe:** Crumbling resort empire masking soft-power control and pleasure-fueled governance  
- **Description:**  
  Crownspire Trust runs Pinnacle Row’s elite resorts, spas, bathhouses, and skyclubs—but beneath the champagne and warm mist lies a ruthless economic engine. They curate indulgence for the rich and powerful, offering “Business Rooms” where deals are sealed mid-pleasure, and entire factions are bought out between float sessions. Every party is a negotiation. Every drink has a clause.  

  Their influence comes not from politics—but from the assumption that **anyone worth knowing is already on their guest list.**

- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  Quietly allied, but spiritually divergent. Lockjaw maintains the system. Crownspire sells it back to its masters. While Lockjaw tightens control, Crownspire lets the powerful forget it exists.

___

## [[GlazeLine]]

- **Region:** Pinnacle Row  
- **Theme:** Clout cartel and curated reality cult  
- **Vibe:** Bimbo-coded influencers with pastel claws and algorithmic knives  
- **Description:**  
  Glazeline runs the social bloodstream of Copperview’s elite. Trendsetters, cancel queens, and reputation tacticians wrapped in shimmer and synthetic glam, they control what’s seen, who’s relevant, and who gets forgotten. Every outfit is a weapon. Every smile is an audition. They don’t rule through law—they rule through *visibility*. And if you’re not trending, you’re not real.

- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  Quietly symbiotic. Lockjaw enforces continuity—Glazeline enforces relevance. Together, they maintain control by making sure no one else gets the spotlight long enough to change anything.

___

## [[Velvetwork]]

- **Region:** Pinnacle Row, with presence in Mirage Rise and high-tier Crownspire venues  
- **Theme:** Intimacy-based influence network secretly run by the Whistletongue Cabal  
- **Vibe:** Silk-wrapped spies, emotional architects, and confession merchants  
- **Description:**  
  Velvetwork presents as a high-end companionship and emotional consultancy syndicate—but it’s actually a sensory espionage network operating beneath Copperview’s glittering elite. Their agents extract secrets through trust, pleasure, and perfectly-timed vulnerability, then pass them along the whisper-chain of the Whistletongue Cabal. They don’t threaten. They listen. They don’t fight. They shift your heart until it breaks *exactly* where they want it to.

- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  Publicly invisible. Lockjaw denies any need for “soft agents.” Privately, several Lockjaw figures are known clients—if not puppets.

---

## [[Coiled Bloom]]

- **Region:** Pinnacle Row (with hidden clinics embedded in Crownspire properties)  
- **Theme:** Elite emotional engineering cartel  
- **Vibe:** Designer drug syndicate meets neural ripperdoc, selling precision mood control with surgical grace  
- **Description:**  
  Coiled Bloom doesn’t offer pleasure—they offer emotional perfection. Their neuroclinics serve Copperview’s elite, providing tailored loyalty treatments, synthetic grief, and chemically-induced serenity. Every service is custom. Every patient leaves changed. Some forget who they were. Others believe they’ve never felt better.

- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  Symbiotic. Lockjaw needs order. Bloom supplies the emotional compliance to sustain it. Officially unaffiliated. Privately, essential.

---

## [[Glitzgarde]]

- **Region:** Pinnacle Row, with visibility-based strike presence across Copperview  
- **Theme:** Militarized aesthetics enforcement  
- **Vibe:** Couture-armored enforcers of visual order and narrative control  
- **Description:**  
  Glitzgarde is Lockjaw’s most visible weapon—an elite fashion-coded military unit that polices rebellion through spectacle and style. They enforce civic discipline by maintaining the city’s visual harmony, targeting symbols of unrest with runway-grade violence and tactical color palettes. Every raid is a photoshoot. Every operation, a performance. They don’t just kill resistance—they make it *look bad*.

- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  Official extension of Lockjaw law. Glitzgarde handles what Lockjaw won’t dirty itself with—civil unrest, trend suppression, and the politics of presence.

---

## [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]

- **Region:** All tiers, but rooted in Pinnacle Row  
- **Theme:** Bureaucratic crime empire masquerading as civic governance  
- **Vibe:** Legacy mafia with golden knuckles and legal briefs, holding the city hostage one permit at a time  
- **Description:**  
  Lockjaw doesn’t run the city from the shadows—they do it from the mayor’s office. A cartel that evolved into infrastructure, they control utilities, licensing, and regulation through layers of corruption, coercion, and controlled chaos. Every power struggle in Copperview is either approved by Lockjaw—or orchestrated by them.  

  Their true weapon isn’t violence—it’s stasis.

- **Relationship to [[Lockjaw Syndicate]]:**  
  They are the system. Other factions rise and fall under their quiet pressure. To oppose them is to try and breathe without permission.
