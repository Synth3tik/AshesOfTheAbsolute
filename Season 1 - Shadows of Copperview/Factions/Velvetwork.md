## Theme & Aesthetic  
Velvetwork is the silken veil stretched over Copperview’s most intimate moments—and the knife hidden in the sheets. Officially, they’re a luxury companionship syndicate offering emotional engagement, aesthetic enhancement, and physical satisfaction. Unofficially, they’re **the Cabal’s listening posts**, **recording devices**, and **memory editors**—collecting secrets whispered under starlit spa domes and between velvet sheets.

Their operatives are actors, listeners, soft interrogators—trained in emotional manipulation, voice cadence reading, non-magical truth coaxing, and redirection through pleasure.

You don’t *hire* a Velvetwork agent.  
You earn one.

## Philosophy & Goals  
- **Belief:** People reveal their truths when they feel most seen—or most desired.  
- **Short-Term:** Maintain access to the city’s most powerful players through service, intimacy, and suggestion.  
- **Long-Term:** Shape high-tier decisions through nudged emotions and planted ideas—without anyone realizing it.  
- **Self-View:** Facilitators of connection. Emotional architects. Reality lubricators.  
- **Outsider View:** Expensive escorts with suspiciously good memory. Everyone says they’re harmless—until they’re not.

## Key Figures  
- **Mirelle Lace** – Official face of Velvetwork. Elegant, ageless, always wearing exactly what makes you feel unworthy. Possibly dozens of clones or a single multi-bodied operator.  
- **The Curtain** – Collective term for the actual controlling node. Rumored to be a rotating panel of Whistletongue operatives. Or a psychic mind-meld across agents. Or a script.  
- **Bellé** – Most-requested operative for political persuasion. Carries no weapons. Has caused six resignations, two divorces, and one religious conversion.

## Influence & Operations  
- Places agents inside **Crownspire spas**, **Clarity Trials**, and **Mirrordome afterparties**.  
- Offers **emotional consultancy** packages: grief processing, desire calibration, social arc advising.  
- Gathers secrets through mirrored confession chambers, “ambient service” exposure, and chemical intimacy enhancers.  
- Known for **confession extraction games**—consensual or otherwise—used to blackmail or reframe political rivals.  
- The **Whistletongue Cabal** uses them to test narrative manipulations in real-time emotional conditions.

## Player Relationship  
- **Early:** The party may interact with Velvetwork through a Crownspire resort or event—an agent offers a service they didn’t request, but sorely need.  
- **Mid:** A contact vanishes after spending time with a Velvetwork agent. Another NPC suddenly acts *very differently* after being “emotionally rebalanced.”  
- **Late:** The party is offered full protection, information, or blackmail materials… in exchange for letting someone into their heart (or bed).

## Known Tactics  
- **Sentiment Splitting:** Extract personal truths through comfort, then subtly use them against the target in future encounters.  
- **Emotional Misdirection:** Displace anger, guilt, or doubt onto a safe political target—paving the way for factional collapse.  
- **Voicehooking:** Train clients to associate safety or power with the presence of a Velvetwork tone or phrase.  
- **Memory Pacing:** Use pharmacological rituals to alter perception of conversations—ensuring only desired truths are retained.

## Rumors & Hooks  
- Mirelle Lace is said to **only appear in dreams**—and yet, every person describes her the same.  
- Velvetwork agents allegedly **don't age**—but one partygoer swears they saw Bellé in a 90-year-old film reel.  
- A prominent Lockjaw advisor is suspected of being a Velvetwork plant—or worse, a loyal client.  
- An agent offers the party a full emotional cleanse in exchange for a secret they don’t even know they’re hiding.

## Symbolism  
- **Primary Icon:** A silk glove folded over a closed mouth.  
- **Style Cues:** Flowing layered robes, perfume-laced skin, vocal augmentation tattoos, mirrored jewelry.  
- **Slogans:**  
  - “Let us make you honest.”  
  - “You wanted to say it. We just helped.”  
  - “What you feel is real. The rest is leverage.”
