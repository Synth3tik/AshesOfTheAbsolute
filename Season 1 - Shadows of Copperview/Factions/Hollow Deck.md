## Type  
Gambling cartel / probabilistic finance syndicate

## Location / Region  
The Crucible, Mirage Rise, Pinnacle Row  
(Each tier hosts a distinct “branch” tailored to its social class)

## Theme & Aesthetic  
The Hollow Deck is a city-spanning house of chance—**casino on the outside, rigged system underneath**. Their agents wear sharp suits or crimson coats, masks during “sacred games,” and carry debt markers like holy relics. Their halls smell of oil, perfume, and copper-polished floorboards.

Their architecture changes by tier:
- **Crucible:** Card dens in warehouses, alley-dice, backroom bookies with ledgers bound in gut parchment.  
- **Mirage Rise:** Velvet-lit casino towers, confidence lounges, elite “chance parlors.”  
- **Pinnacle Row:** Private game salons where deals are dressed as intellectual wagers—bets of theory, ideology, or futures.

## Philosophy & Goals  
- **Belief:** Risk reveals truth. Control the odds, and you control fate.  
- **Short-Term:** Expand credit operations and crush unlicensed gambling to secure dominance.  
- **Long-Term:** Replace social mobility with probabilistic advancement. You don't climb in Copperview—you *roll*.  
- **Self-View:** Patrons of fortune, curators of chaos, and caretakers of the only honest system: the gamble.  
- **Outsider View:** High-class loan sharks. They sell illusion and call it luck, chaining souls to dice rolls and IOUs.

## Key Figures  
- **Vel Rimm, “The Dealer”** – The public face of the Hollow Deck. Always seen at opening tables, never anywhere twice. Charismatic, unreadable, rumored to have once bet away their own name.  
- **Madam Quill** – Overseer of the Pinnacle salons. Speaks only in wagers. Believes every ideology can be reduced to a dice game—and rigs accordingly.  
- **Jax Pinch** – Enforcer and debt collector for the Crucible ring. Once lost both arms in a game, now replaced with collapsible brass gauntlets. Whispers before he hits.  
- **The Table That Watches** – A sentient construct housed in a secure vault deep beneath Mirage Rise. It deals fate—not cards—and the high rollers pay dearly for a reading.

## Influence & Operations  
- Manages most of the **licensed gambling** in Copperview—legal and otherwise.  
- Maintains a vast network of **debt markers**, which serve as both credit and spiritual contract.  
- Runs a shadow-market of **risk brokers**, hired to rig outcomes in subtle, narrative-defining ways.  
- Offers “**Wager Loans**,” where repayment isn't money—but events. (Lose, and your child owes the win.)  
- Hosts city-wide “**Fortune Festivals**,” which spark tier-wide instability under the guise of celebration.

## Player Relationship  
- **Early:** The party may gamble for favors, information, or entry—only to realize they're playing by invisible rules.  
- **Mid:** Hollow Deck agents approach with offers: coin, shelter, upgrades... in exchange for a harmless little wager.  
- **Late:** The party may discover that major faction shifts are being orchestrated by Hollow Deck bets. To stop the game, they’ll need to *break the house.*

## Known Tactics  
- **Probabilistic Warfare:** Stage events to appear natural—random—but actually designed outcomes (the “Long Bet” strategy).  
- **Debt Forcing:** Offer help during desperation, then enforce soul-binding contracts written in mathematical notation.  
- **Event Rigs:** Public games where the outcome sets city policy for a week—rigged, of course.  
- **Double Agents:** They fund both sides of a conflict and bet on the result.

## Rumors & Hooks  
- A **high-tier game** recently vanished mid-round—everyone at the table presumed dead, but no bodies found.  
- A **prophecy** once rolled at the Table That Watches has come true… three times.  
- The party is unknowingly holding a **cursed debt token**, given to them by a helpful gambler.  
- A **former Lockjaw bureaucrat** is rumored to be rigging city permits using Hollow Deck odds-charts.

## Symbolism  
- **Primary Mark:** A golden dealer’s chip with a hollow ring at the center—no emblem inside.  
- **Visual Tags:** Red-twined betting slips. Gloves with playing card suits sewn into the palms.  
- **Sayings:**  
  - “The odds are in our favor.”  
  - “You only lose if you leave the table.”  
  - “Chance is fair. We just know more of it.”
