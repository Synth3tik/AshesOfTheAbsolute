## Type  
Fragmented ancestral war-clans / tech-shamanic scrap cults

## Location / Region  
Rustfloor (dominant faction)  
Minor tunnels and vents connected to the Winding Descent and lower Crucible

## Theme & Aesthetic  
The Rustblood Kin are Copperview’s forgotten foundation—literal and spiritual. They are not a single group, but a sprawling tangle of blood-bound goblin clans, tech-shamans, rustpriests, and forgebound warlords. Each cell guards a different scrap relic, old power line, defunct factory, or reactor core like it’s holy. To the Kin, **machines aren’t tools—they’re ancestors**, and the Rustfloor is sacred soil corrupted by those who built upward without honor.

The Kin don’t speak with unified voice—they speak through ritual, metalwork, and **force**. Their armor is welded, patched, engraved with the names of lost mines and shattered elevator lines. Their weapons were built for something else—but reforged for war.

## Philosophy & Goals  
- **Belief:** The soul of Copperview lives in rust, vibration, and the sacred machines below. Anything built above is stolen glory.  
- **Short-Term:** Drive out invasive infrastructure and reclaim relic-sites buried by modern progress.  
- **Long-Term:** Restore the old circuits, tear down the “false layers,” and return Copperview to its true root.  
- **Self-View:** Guardians of the buried truth. Heirs to the steel below.  
- **Outsider View:** Mad, violent junk cults who see meaning in dead wire and spilled oil.

## Key Figures  
- **Forge-Cracked Aruun** – A unifier-warrior with half his skull replaced by a memory crucible. Sometimes speaks in binary prayer.  
- **Grakka of the Nine-Spark Maw** – Tech-shamaness who eats corrupted batteries and sees ghosts in melted wires.  
- **The Clanghold Triad** – Rotating leadership of the strongest Kin clans, who only meet beneath the city’s last functioning piston column.

## Influence & Operations  
- Control much of the Rustfloor through territorial claim and environmental resistance.  
- Known to hold “**gearwakes**”—rituals where broken machines are mourned, scavenged, and reborn as war tools.  
- Use **signal totems**—humming constructs that ward or mark territory through rhythm and static.  
- Conduct **ambush raids** from duct systems, steam tunnels, and lift shafts—always brutal, always personal.  
- Refuse to use modern permits, currency, or documentation. Their contracts are carved into steel and signed in sparks.

## Player Relationship  
- **Early:** The party may cross into Kin territory unknowingly, triggering a test, a fight, or a rite.  
- **Mid:** A Kin-forged weapon or sacred site may hold the answer to an ancient mystery the party’s unraveling.  
- **Late:** A fractured Kin council could unify behind the party—or become an uncontrollable blaze that tears Copperview down from the bottom up.

## Known Tactics  
- **Relic Bombing:** Overload old generators or forgotten engine cores to create massive, localized destruction.  
- **Weldbrand Trials:** Ritualized duels to settle disputes, often conducted on red-hot scrap scaffolding.  
- **Echo Tapping:** Use seismic pulses through metal bones of the city to spy, signal, or collapse infrastructure above.  
- **Scrap-Shielding:** Plate armor embedded with signal-dampening slag and emotional suppression glyphs.

## Rumors & Hooks  
- A Kin clan is building something deep beneath a rust-choked tunnel—a machine that hasn’t turned in centuries, and shouldn’t.  
- One of the party’s weapons may be made from a stolen relic-core—putting them in immediate danger or under sacred protection.  
- An ancient Kin language, spoken only through hammer strikes, may be the key to opening a sealed underground vault.  
- Some say the Kin used to *rule* Copperview—before the rise of Lockjaw. Others say they never stopped.

## Symbolism  
- **Primary Icon:** A cracked gear wrapped in wire and inscribed with clan runes.  
- **Style Cues:** Scar-welded armor, burnt oil markings, teeth replaced with iron nubs, bone-tethered tools.  
- **Slogans:**  
  - “Below remembers.”  
  - “Metal is ancestor. Blood is bond.”  
  - “Upward is betrayal.”
