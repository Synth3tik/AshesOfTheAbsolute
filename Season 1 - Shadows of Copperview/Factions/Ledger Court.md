## Type  
Contractarian guild-theocracy / credit enforcement authority

## Location / Region  
Mirage Rise (primary), but their influence permeates all tiers via financial and contractual control

## Theme & Aesthetic  
A financial cult disguised as a civic institution. The Ledger Court is a network of economic judges, debt theologians, and clause-bound executioners who rule Copperview not through fear, but through **fiscal inevitability**. They dress in long silk robes stained with ink and clause-blood, each thread bearing text from a fulfilled contract or dead pact. Their offices look like temples crossed with tax archives—scented with old vellum, hot wax, and dried trust.

Their speech is slow, meticulous, and final. Every word feels like it was reviewed by a legal team—because it was.

## Philosophy & Goals  
- **Belief:** All things accrue interest. Debt is the true force of nature.  
- **Short-Term:** Expand control over civic debt enforcement and formalize their economic arbitration courts into actual governance.  
- **Long-Term:** Enshrine The Ledger as the only valid source of law—transforming all contracts, oaths, and systems into debt-based obedience.  
- **Self-View:** Stewards of balance. Guardians of lawful exchange. They do not enforce morality—they enforce math.  
- **Outsider View:** Predatory accountants playing god with a gold-dipped quill and a ticking clock.

## Key Figures  
- **Magister Keelth Vyre** – High Chancellor of The Ledger. Blindfolded by choice, claims to “read the weights.” Uses a self-writing book bound to his heart. Cannot break a clause—physically.  
- **Collector Talzine “Two Hands”** – A former market judge turned bounty-forger. Known for issuing “double-bound writs”—where both sides of a conflict end up owing the Court.  
- **Archivist Norrik** – Keeper of the Living Ledger: a semi-sapient contractual database that predates even Lockjaw's rise. Occasionally “offers” clauses on its own.

## Influence & Operations  
- Owns or underwrites **most public infrastructure debt** in Mirage Rise and half of Pinnacle Row.  
- Controls the **City Credit Roll**—a record of all known debts, investments, and blacklisted identities.  
- Runs **arbitration temples**, where business and political disputes are resolved by binding wager or clause challenge.  
- Enforces “final clauses” through bounty-licensed agents known as **Coinhawks**, who are both executioners and debt collectors.  
- Known to write **multi-generational debts**, binding families or factions across decades with impossible clauses hidden in fine print.

## Player Relationship  
- **Early:** The party might become entangled in debt without realizing it—perhaps by accepting an “interest-free” item, or by being named as clause inheritors.  
- **Mid:** The Court offers options. Always clean. Always legal. Always compromising. “You *could* pay your way out of this. We’ll even help.”  
- **Late:** The players may need to burn or rewrite the Ledger itself to stop a citywide foreclosure—if they can even find where it’s kept.

## Known Tactics  
- **Clause Traps:** Contracts embedded with paradoxes, inheritance triggers, or latent obligations.  
- **Clause Arbitration:** Offer enemy factions relief in exchange for “fiscal rebalancing” that turns them into pawns.  
- **Enforced Silence:** Contracts that bind the tongue, memories, or intent—perfectly legal, if morally absent.  
- **Debt as Leverage:** Use unpaid favors, false inheritances, or forged clauses to pull rivals apart.

## Rumors & Hooks  
- A contract hidden deep in The Ledger allegedly binds Lockjaw itself to a forgotten debt—one the Court refuses to enforce… yet.  
- Archivist Norrik has begun leaking *“unauthorized amendments.”* No one knows who they're meant for.  
- A cursed clause has infected a neighborhood—anyone who leaves owes a debt. Anyone who stays *becomes* one.  
- The Court has recently invited the Hollow Deck to “negotiate a cooperative clause system”—a union of odds and contracts.

## Symbolism  
- **Primary Mark:** A black coin split by a silver line—one side etched, one side blank. Always balanced.  
- **Visual Tags:** Scrolls burned at one end, ledgers chained to desks, coin-weights set on judgment altars.  
- **Sayings:**  
  - “Balance binds us.”  
  - “Oath without ledger is wind.”  
  - “We are not cruel. We are accurate.”
