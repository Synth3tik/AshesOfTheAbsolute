## 🧷 Overview

The [[Grimebound]] are the **territorial, instinctive hoarders** of the [[Rustblood Kin]]—a superstitious goblin-lineage that believes **old machine parts are alive**, **angry**, and **sacred**.  

They don’t understand the machines. They *remember them*.  
But memory doesn’t need logic. It needs **rituals, screaming, and grease**.

Grimebound territories are full of stacked “memory piles,” tangled “cling lines,” and sacred components they absolutely refuse to move—even when crushed beneath them.

## 🛠️ Practices & Rituals

- **Rust Rights** – No part may be moved without being named and sung to  
- **Cling Lines** – Holy tangles of twine, wire, and prayer-hooks that “connect” relics together  
- **Slap Tests** – Ritualized whacking of objects to “hear if the ghost is mad”  
- **Memory Piles** – Part shrines built from broken machines, guarded like ancestors’ graves

## 🤯 Beliefs

- Sparks are thoughts.  
- Leaks are sadness.  
- Screeches are warnings.  
- If you *understand* what it does, you’ve killed its spirit.

Machines aren’t tools. They’re **grumpy old gods** that live in pieces and must be honored with weird rules.

## 🌫️ Tone & Aesthetic

- Cave-shelves of rusted junk lit by bulb-altars  
- Twine-strung tunnels full of wire chimes and scrap charms  
- Oil-slicked goblins bickering over which pile belongs to which “auntie machine”  
- No straight paths. No clean surfaces. No wrong beliefs—just louder ones.
