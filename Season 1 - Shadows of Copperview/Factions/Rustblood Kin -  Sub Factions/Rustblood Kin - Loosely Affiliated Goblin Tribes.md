**Parent Faction:** [[Rustblood Kin]]  
**Region:** [[Rustfloor]]  
**Type:** Independent micro-tribes bound by ancestry, ritual, and rust  
**Overview:**  
Not all goblins under the Rustblood Kin banner belong to a dominant sect like the [[Gnarlfaith]], [[Ironmaw Kin]], or [[Grimebound]]. Scattered throughout [[Rustfloor]] are smaller tribes—each with their own warped rituals, ancestral beliefs, and mechanical superstitions. Some feud. Some trade. All are dangerous, especially when misunderstood.
