## 🧷 Overview

The [[Gnarlfaith]] is a sect of the [[Rustblood Kin]] who believe that the machines of the old city can only be understood through **suffering, combustion, and sacred entropy**.  
They do not repair. They do not build.  
They **feed**, **burn**, and **listen**.

To the Gnarlfaith, [[The Gullet]] is alive—a divine being made of echoing pipes, rusted dreams, and smoldering silence. They act as its caretakers, celebrants, and interpreters of its fiery “voice.”

## 🏚️ The Gullet

See: [[The Gullet]]

A collapsed waste incinerator turned vertical shrine, The Gullet is where the Gnarlfaith conduct sacrificial rites, chant into steam lungs, and await signs from the city’s molten past.  
Its halls drip with oil and prophecy.

- **Flame Reading** – interpreting visions in thermal venting patterns or burn marks on offerings
- **Ash Consecration** – sacred ash mixed with blood used to mark the faithful

## 🛠️ Ideology & Myth

- Machines **dream**, not function—understanding is sacrilege  
- Pain is not to be avoided—it is how the city **teaches**
