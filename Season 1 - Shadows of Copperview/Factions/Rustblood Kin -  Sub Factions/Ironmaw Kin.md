## 🧷 Overview

The [[Ironmaw Kin]] are a militant and barbaric sect of the [[Rustblood Kin]] that embrace **brutality as reverence**. To them, the machines of the old city responded to strength, and the ancestors lived through pain.  
They believe **violence awakens memory**, and scars are a kind of scripture.  

The Ironmaw aren’t mindless—they are *ritualistically angry*. Their lives are a series of clang-rings, duels, and blood-soaked rites performed against steel altars and screaming pipes.

## 🏚️ The Splitforge

See: [[The Splitforge]]

A shattered industrial dome turned open-air war pit, the Splitforge is the Ironmaw’s base of operations and proving ground. Anyone may challenge, but only those who draw blood on the sacred metal can earn respect.

## 🧱 Practices & Beliefs

- **Clang-Rings** – sacred duels fought on sound-reactive steel platforms. Echoes are believed to carry memory upward.
- **Oil Baptisms** – initiation rites where new Ironmaw are dunked in hot oil and soot.
- **Scar Rituals** – every wound is marked, recited, and remembered as part of a bloodline.
- **Machine Communion** – broken parts of defeated machines are worn as trophies or grafted into ceremonial gear.

## ⚔️ Combat Style

- Crude weapons forged from industrial scrap: wrench-axes, jagged blade-fans, piston-fists.
- Favors brute strength and intimidation over finesse.
- Often enter battle roaring “Memory bleeds!”—a chant that doubles as a declaration and a warning.
