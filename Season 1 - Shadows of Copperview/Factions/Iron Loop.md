## Type  
Freight syndicate / militant logistics cartel

## Location / Region  
The Crucible, Winding Descent, Rustfloor tunnels

## Theme & Aesthetic  
The Loop is motion made manifest—trains, cargo lifts, checkpoint barricades, and rotating track offices. Their people wear heavy coats layered in soot and sealant, wielding pipewrenches like sidearms. Their colors are steel gray, brass, and warning-yellow. Every rank wears an iron ring stamped with their first route.

Their armor is industrial. Their language is transactional. Their power lies in control of movement—and they never let anyone forget it.

## Philosophy & Goals  
- **Belief:** Control the flow, and you control the city.  
- **Short-Term:** Maintain dominance over Copperview’s logistics by sabotaging rival routes and undercutting Lockjaw influence.  
- **Long-Term:** Become the *infrastructure*, not just a faction within it.  
- **Self-View:** Essential workers protecting order and dignity through tough choices.  
- **Outsider View:** Corrupt bribe-mongers who run transport like a toll-bridge to hell.

## Key Figures  
- **Brakeboss Marrin** – Field Marshal of Checkpoint Ironjaw. Gruff, immovable, and known for crushing protests with water cannons or work permits—whichever’s easier.  
- **Zae “Torchline” Vekk** – Burnside Ledger rep. Runs civic-facing negotiations and bribe optimization. Cunning, well-spoken, and always one favor ahead.  
- **The Brassboard** – Rotating leadership council held on a secure train known as *The Redline*. Their meetings only happen while in motion. Miss the train, miss your vote.

## Influence & Operations  
- Operates the city’s **entire freight rail network**, cargo lift system, and critical checkpoint infrastructure.  
- Controls **Checkpoint Ironjaw**, the gateway into Copperview. Migrants, merchants, and smugglers all pass through Loop-controlled gates.  
- Maintains loyalty through “Transit Bonds”—job-for-life contracts in exchange for movement privileges, often exploited.  
- Runs *"ghost lanes”*—unlisted transport paths only accessible via internal clearance or forged sigils.  

## Player Relationship  
- **Early:** The PCs must deal with Iron Loop bureaucracy at Checkpoint Ironjaw. This includes aggressive permit inspections, bribe hints, faction job offers, or threats.  
- **Mid:** The PCs may need to use the Loop to move goods or people, forge documents, or sabotage rival shipments. Their influence becomes *inescapable*.  
- **Late:** The party may have to choose: disrupt the Loop to cripple Lockjaw’s supply chains—or use the Loop as the backbone for their own revolution.

## Known Tactics  
- **Negotiation by obstruction:** Delay what others need until the price rises.  
- **Union-backed force:** Strike squads, freight-trained bruisers, and “railgun crews” using weaponized track tools.  
- **Infrastructure warfare:** Blockades, derailed transports, or timed lift failures used as strategic retaliation.  
- **Transit Surveillance:** Every major platform has at least one Loop informant—or drone-walker, disguised as a luggage bot.

## Rumors & Hooks  
- A **Loop archivist went missing** after mapping a dead rail leading deep under the Rustfloor—rumors say the route predates the city.  
- Zae Vekk is allegedly **double-dealing** with Lockjaw and sabotaging internal unity to broker a new “Iron Accord.”  
- The party hears of a **ghost train** that doesn’t stop—boarding it might reveal what the Loop *really* moves for.  
- The **next Brassboard vote** could determine whether the Loop supports or resists Lockjaw’s economic grip—if someone doesn't sabotage it first.

## Symbolism  
- **Primary Symbol:** A looped iron ring with a track spike driven through the center.  
- **Informal Tags:** Rail glyphs etched into station walls or freight crates.  
- **Slogans & Sayings:**  
  - “What moves, we own.”  
  - “Nothing enters. Nothing leaves. Unless it’s us.”  
  - “Strike the flow, starve the city.”
