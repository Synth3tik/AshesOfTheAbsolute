## Type  
Militarized aesthetics bureau / Lockjaw-aligned enforcement unit

## Location / Region  
Pinnacle Row (primary staging and fashion arsenal)  
Strike presence in all districts via spectacle-based shock raids

## Theme & Aesthetic  
Glitzgarde is **fashion as force**—Copperview’s most aggressive visual authority and Lockjaw’s silent threat. They aren’t just soldiers; they’re **choreographed enforcers of order**, trained in riot suppression and runway discipline. Their uniforms shift colors based on command intent. Their banners double as crowd-control barriers. Their capes are cut from sound-dampening cloth and laced with tracking threads.

Every deployment is a performance.  
Every raid is a statement.

They patrol protests in stilettos.  
They serve subpoenas with confetti cannons.

## Philosophy & Goals  
- **Belief:** Rebellion begins in asymmetry. A just society is well-tailored.  
- **Short-Term:** Eliminate unrest through hyper-visible shows of unity, polish, and coordinated threat.  
- **Long-Term:** Codify style as civic obedience—making fashion law and aesthetics governance.  
- **Self-View:** Symbols of pride, icons of protection, living uniforms of the state.  
- **Outsider View:** Violent influencers with armored cheekbones and zero chill.

## Key Figures  
- **Marshal Rhun Kaelle** – Supreme Commander. Dresses like a conceptual opera villain. Believes violence is fine—but only if the silhouette slaps.  
- **Captain Fennix Vale** – Fashion tactician. Oversees uniform updates, disciplinary couture, and “misbrand evaluations.”  
- **The Lookdown Unit** – Elite snipers trained to target visual dissidents. Their rifles are color-matched to seasonal palettes.

## Influence & Operations  
- Enforces aesthetic law across the city—particularly in Pinnacle, where fashion *is* identity.  
- Runs **visual compliance audits** on factions during public events. A failed look may result in fines, arrest, or unpersoning.  
- Issues “**Style Citations**” that stack like warrants. Repeat offenders may be forcibly re-outfitted.  
- Carries out “**Statement Raids**”—crushing dissent through perfectly choreographed brutality designed to trend.  
- Works directly with Glazeline and Lockjaw to ensure **narrative-aligned fashion control**.

## Player Relationship  
- **Early:** The party runs afoul of a “visual conflict clause” and is warned—or fined.  
- **Mid:** A rebel ally is detained for "symbological dissonance." To free them, the party must pass a style tribunal.  
- **Late:** The party becomes a fashion statement themselves. Glitzgarde demands they align—or be erased from civic memory.

## Known Tactics  
- **Flashpack Suppression:** Dazzling light bursts that burn out low-grade optics and kill audience footage.  
- **Mood Palette Blitz:** Deploys calming or aggressive visual tones via cloak arrays to alter crowd behavior.  
- **Rhetoric Projection:** Projects slogans through hologram capes during combat for psychological dominance.  
- **Threadtraps:** Nano-thread snares hidden in abandoned coats or scarves—activated by contact or disrespect.

## Rumors & Hooks  
- Glitzgarde’s armor line was co-designed by **Coiled Bloom** and **Crownspire**—with hidden compliance pheromones woven in.  
- Marshal Kaelle once “disappeared” an entire protest by declaring it off-season.  
- A new “Vigil Model” Glitzgarde suit has no wearer—only behavior. It allegedly wears *you*.  
- They’re building a **catwalk tribunal stage** that collapses into a riot pit mid-judgment.

## Symbolism  
- **Primary Icon:** A polished mannequin bust wearing a crown split with a blade.  
- **Style Cues:** Metallic silks, asymmetrical armor, mirrored visors, high-drama capes, steel-trimmed heels.  
- **Slogans:**  
  - “Disobedience is off-brand.”  
  - “Civility is couture.”  
  - “We don’t kill rebels. We make them irrelevant.”
