## Type  
Deconstructed labor movement / anti-verticalist insurgents

## Location / Region  
Primarily The Crucible and lower tiers; remnants scattered through Rustfloor

## Theme & Aesthetic  
Disbanded engineers, elevator crews, and structural tacticians-turned-anarchists. Their gear is patchworked rigging harnesses, roadworn work boots, and repurposed industrial uniforms marked with upside-down safety glyphs. Every Fracture cell carries their own version of the “equality toolkit”: collapsible crowbars, pulley-slicers, explosive anchors, and chalk slogans.

They don’t just reject the system—they demolish its foundations, one stairwell at a time.

## Philosophy & Goals  
- **Belief:** The verticality of Copperview is not just infrastructure—it’s oppression embodied.  
- **Short-Term:** Disable tier control systems (elevators, lift rails, security checkpoints) and expose Lockjaw’s engineered hierarchy.  
- **Long-Term:** Level the city—socially and literally—so no goblin ever has to look up to power again.  
- **Self-View:** Builders turned liberators. Fighting with the only tools they were ever allowed to hold.  
- **Outsider View:** Delusional saboteurs responsible for fatal collapses and citywide instability.

## Key Figures  
- **Kesra Tun** – Ex-Iron Loop lift designer turned radical. Missing an arm (replaced by a pulley-socket rig), she leads a surviving cell near the Spine of the Crucible. Speaks in slogans and stares like she’s measuring your center of gravity.  
- **Rell the Nail-Counter** – Keeps track of every fastener, bolt, or beam the Union ever placed—then logs which were “corrected.” Carries a rivet launcher and an archive scroll.  
- **The First Fall** – Allegedly the founder, now a martyr myth. Some say he leapt from Pinnacle Row to prove a point. Others say he was pushed.

## Influence & Operations  
- Now fractured into **micro-cells**, operating independently with only ritual codes to link them.  
- Known for **structural sabotage**, rerouted lifts, vanished stairwells, and scaffolding collapses blamed on “accidents.”  
- Each act of destruction is treated as sacred: *“Level one thing. Free one mind.”*  
- Formerly widespread. Now hunted, disbanded, and publicly condemned—though their symbols still show up in chalk where they shouldn’t.

## Player Relationship  
- **Early:** Rumored to be behind the recent city destabilizations. Convenient scapegoats for the murder mystery. Everyone’s sure it’s them.  
- **Mid:** The party may uncover surviving cells, who deny involvement—but offer insights no one else dares speak aloud.  
- **Late:** If restored, the Fracture Union could serve as a movement engine for revolution—or become a tragedy, buried beneath collapsing ideals.

## Known Tactics  
- **Counter-elevation attacks** – Bringing down platforms mid-ascent, cutting pulleys at symbolic moments.  
- **Shadow rigging** – Setting up false construction that fails as sabotage.  
- **Structural encryption** – Using building blueprints like secret languages. Messages only visible to those who built them.  
- **Symbolic Demolition** – Tearing down the first stair of a noble home. Melting the capstone of a district obelisk. Making elevation feel fragile.

## Rumors & Hooks  
- A collapsed transport bridge matches an old Fracture pattern—but too perfectly. Someone might be mimicking them.  
- Kesra Tun is said to carry **a schematic that proves** the vertical hierarchy was Lockjaw-engineered from the start.  
- Their “dead” founder may still live in the broken scaffolds of Pinnacle Row’s understructure—watching.  
- A Lockjaw strike team recovered an encrypted blueprint labeled **“Final Collapse”**—but no one can read it.

## Symbolism  
- **Primary Mark:** An inverted triangle stamped into concrete or welded onto service plates.  
- **Tags:** “No Up.” “Collapse the Pattern.” “Level Means Equal.”  
- **Colors:** Ash gray, hazard orange, blood-rusted red.
