**Type:** Decentralized conspiracy cult / ideological infection  
**Region:** Primarily [[Rustfloor]], with symbols and cells reported as high as [[The Crucible]] and [[Mirage Rise]]  
**True Function:** Subtle narrative vector for [[Unknown]]'s forgotten agenda  
**Tone:** Unsettling, prophetic, wrong—but not entirely

## 🧷 Overview

The [[Coil-Eaters]] aren’t a faction in the traditional sense. They’re a **side effect**—the ideological fallout of something deeper, older, and partially buried.  

Their members interpret hallucinations as holy truths, dissect circuitry for metaphor, and treat graffiti as sacred. They see the city as a prison, a loop, a machine-god gone mad.  

**They are not wrong. Not exactly. But they are no longer sane.**

---

## 🧠 Beliefs & Core Tenets

- **Copperview is a Loop**: The city resets, replays, forgets. Reality is maintained like old infrastructure—patched, not solved.  
- **All Factions Are Puppets**: Their actions predictable, rehearsed, or *pre-scripted*.  
- **The “One Beneath” Watches**: An unseen intelligence or pattern. Some say it’s a god, others a glitch. The more accurate ones don’t say anything at all.  
- **Breaking the Pattern**: Some want to map it. Some want to warn others. Some want to shatter it at any cost.

## 🧬 Hidden Truth

> They are infected by [[Unknown]]'s broken influence—snippets of corrupted philosophy, half-completed code, and recursive memory splinters.  
> They don’t *understand* it. But they carry echoes of the truth.  
> They speak [[Unknown]]’s fragments—without context, clarity, or consent.

## 🧷 Cell Identity

Each cell is different. No shared doctrine. No central command.

- Some worship machines. Others fear them.  
- Some paint warnings. Others broadcast sermons in reverse.  
- Many see Coil-Eater visions before joining. Fewer survive them.

Their language changes constantly, but certain **symbols persist**:
- **The Inverted Coil** – truth unspooled  
- **The Bleeding Circuit** – knowledge that injures  
- **Teeth in the Wire** – something watching through machines

## 🗺️ Influence Zones

The Coil-Eaters do not have a central HQ. Instead, they infect the landscape through **haunt zones**, such as:

- [[Coil-Tangle Alley]] – dream-graffiti sermons, shifting logic  
- [[Echoback Hollow]] – where whispers override thought  
- [[The Inktrace Drain]] – luminous oil dreams passed as prophecy  
- [[The Candlemap]] – symbol-wall tracking “emotional ruptures” in the city

## 🧙 Key Figures

### [[Ward]]  
- Rustworker turned preacher  
- Believes the city’s structure is a *ritual glyph*  
- Thinks [[Unknown]] is already speaking through graffiti, circuitry, and dreams

### [[Gresh]]  
- Maintains the **Great Diagram**  
- Claims Coil-Eaters are “just readers” of the Coil—not its masters  
- Treats everything as evidence. Even what disproves him.

### [[“Prophet” Quell]]  
- Currently embedded in [[The Gullet]]  
- Whispers half-coherent sermons about “the waking machine beneath the bones”  
- May be the closest thing the Coil-Eaters have to a true oracle—and they don’t even trust him

## 🎲 Player Relationship

- **Early Game:** A weird pamphlet. A chalk spiral on a wall. Some guy with signal-static eyes.  
- **Mid Game:** A prediction comes true. Someone dies. A diagram matches a real event.  
- **Late Game:** The pieces click. The message wasn’t random. The pattern was real.  
- **Endgame:** The Coil-Eaters have been repeating Kaelith’s signal this entire time. Players just never tuned into the right frequency.

## 🛠️ Tactics & Tools

- **Symbols & Tags:** Chalk spirals, rust runes, circuit-teeth glyphs  
- **Tools:** Dream-ink projectors, signal disruptors, logic-splinter bombs  
- **Methods:** Chaos, confusion, recursive reasoning—“truths that injure when understood”

## 🪞 Rumors & Foreshadowing Threads

- A Lockjaw server was breached—but only old memories were stolen  
- Coil-Eater graffiti starts appearing *before* an incident happens  
- One of the PCs has a Coil-Eater glyph drawn near their sleeping area—*every night*  
- The “One Beneath” isn’t real. Unless it already is. Unless it *used to be*

## 💬 Coil-Eater Sayings

> “You swallowed your piece already. You just haven’t choked on it yet.”  
> “The Coil doesn’t lie. It loops.”  
> “If you dream in static, don’t wake up.”  
> “We are echoes of something that wants out.”

## 🌫️ Tone & Aesthetic

- Tinfoil scribblers. Junk-prophet aesthetics. Hallucinated truth-sculptors.  
- Chalk symbols in maintenance ducts. Radios whispering blood-code.  
- Boiler-room confessions. Reverse-speaking audio shrines.  
- Holy diagrams built from wire and teeth.
