## 🔥 Overview

Lockjaw runs Copperview like a racket dressed in gold-trimmed paperwork. They rose from the ruins of past regimes and rewrote the rules in their favor. Every permit, policy, and parade is a tool to maintain their grip—and anyone climbing the ladder best pay tribute or expect a fall.

>They aren’t the government.  
>They just own it.

---

## 💣 Core Identity

Lockjaw operates like a dynasty of gangsters who made it big and never stopped hustling. They *like* the city messy. It’s easier to tax desperation than ambition. They don’t mind innovation as long as they get a cut—and anyone dreaming of revolution better be ready to bleed for it.

> “Everybody gets a cut—until they try to cut us out.”  
> “You want to build something in Copperview? You build it on Lockjaw’s terms.”  
> “Progress don’t mean nothin’ if it don’t pay tribute.”

---

## 💼 Structure

Lockjaw is run like a crime family that happens to own most of the paperwork.  
Their inner council—**The Jawline**—are old-money fixers and street-bred climbers held together by blood debts, blackmail, and shared enemies.

>They don’t believe in equality.  
>They believe in *leverage.*

## 🧠 Philosophy

- **Control Through Corruption** – Everything from the power grid to parades runs through their hands.
- **Profit Through Chaos** – Unrest makes people desperate. Desperation makes people pliable.
- **Power Through Loyalty** – You don’t rise in Lockjaw without kissing rings and breaking bones.

---

## 🎭 Public Face vs Real Power

**On paper:** Lockjaw is a “multi-faceted civic enterprise” responsible for utilities, licensing, and urban renewal.  
**In practice:** They extort, bribe, and silence. The line between city office and mob hangout is nonexistent.

>Their charities launder money.  
>Their permits control who eats.  
>Their courts settle scores.

- **Enforcers:** Mid-tier “Jawbreakers” wear brass-knuckled gloves, long coats with faction badges hidden beneath, and speak in legal euphemisms or vague proverbs.

## The Jawline – Lockjaw’s Inner Circle

---

[[Karn “Golden Knuckles” Trosk]] – _The Fist on the Throne_

> A showman warlord turned “chancellor,” Karn masks brutality with bluster—until the gloves come off and the gold starts cracking skulls.

---

**Vezka Mire** – _The Whisper With Teeth_

> Lockjaw’s invisible knife, she speaks in riddles and ruins, and no one knows they’re her target until their life collapses.

---

**Breq Saltvine** – _The Smile That Cuts_

> Copperview’s darling socialite, Breq weaponizes charm, gossip, and city-wide influence like scalpels to peel power from her enemies.

---

**Unit-07 “Ledger”** – _The Brain in the Basement_

> A paranoid, self-learning construct powered by old-world code and modern corruption—Ledger calculates rebellions before they begin.

---

**“Uncle Drip”** – _The Collector in the Gutters_

> Sewer baron and enforcer of Lockjaw’s debts, Uncle Drip is all sludge, gold teeth, and “gentle” reminders of who really owns your bones.

---

**Zinka “Torchlaw” Reeve** – _The Enforcer Queen_

> Once a pyromancer revolutionary, now a mercenary juggernaut for Lockjaw—she believes freedom means enforcing their rules first.

---

**Tog & Reel** – _The Two-Headed Act_

> Twin performance killers and logistics fixers, they handle “sensitive removals” with flair, shadow puppets, and synchronized executions.

---

**Lady Grivve** – _The Goldsigil Widow_

> An ancient advisor with a permanent smirk and too many rings, she treats politics like theatre—and the audience always dies in Act III.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Prevent any power shift that doesn’t benefit them.
- Control narrative, innovation, and economic ascent.
- Exploit new tech and talent while keeping true power gatekept.
- Keep Copperview messy enough to manipulate—but never messy enough to break.

---

## ⚙️ Operations

- **Licensing Rackets** – Everyone pays to play. Or gets shut down.  
- **Debt Diplomacy** – Grants and support programs that turn into golden shackles.  
- **Public Good Fronts** – Galas, fundraisers, and “free energy drives” that enrich Lockjaw and crush dissent.  
- **Internal Arbitration** – Secret conflict resolution that always favors the syndicate.  
- **Ghost Crews** – Disappearances, sabotage, and whisper campaigns to neutralize threats quietly.

---

## 🎲 Player Relationship

- **Early Game:** Helpful. Even generous. They might grease some wheels.  
- **Mid Game:** They get in the way. Suddenly you need permits, favors, or to stop investigating certain names.  
- **Late Game:** They are the wall between the party and real progress. Taking them down means taking apart the city’s entire power structure.

## 🎩 Style & Symbolism

- **Symbol:** A closed copper jaw with interlocking teeth.  
- **Style:**  
  - Gold chains, polished boots, and coats lined with bomb-proof silk.  
  - Offices in copper-lit dens lined with trophies, bribes, and silence.  
  - Cigar smoke, black-market tech, and ancient family sigils carved into desks.

---

## 🕳️ Rumors & Hooks

- The Loose Teeth are whispering about “a new Copperview,” where dues aren't extorted, and power isn't inherited. No one knows who leads them—but their symbol is a cracked copper fang, drawn in acid on Lockjaw-owned walls.
- It’s said Karn keeps a vault called the “Black Binder”—a hidden ledger of bribes, betrayals, and broken pacts. If the pages ever got out, Copperview would implode overnight.
- Unit-07 is allegedly sapient—but no one knows who built it.

## 🐍 Weaponized Chaos: Lockjaw's Hidden Hand

Lockjaw doesn’t win through open war—they win by turning everyone else’s war into an *investment*. They seed chaos where it will grow most explosively, stoke rivalries that pull attention away from the top, and profit off the aftermath.

Every protest has a sponsor. Every uprising has a leak. Every gang war ends with Lockjaw holding the deed to the ashes.

**They don’t throw punches. They sponsor brawls.**

---

### 💥 How They Do It:

- **Double-Backed Funding** – They bankroll multiple factions in the same neighborhood, each thinking they’re Lockjaw’s chosen favorites. When they clash, Lockjaw buys up the ruins.
  
- **Information Seeding** – Carefully leaked intel escalates tensions just enough to trigger violence. Usually via a third-party smuggler, “independent” journalist, or anonymous whisper campaign.
  
- **False-Flag Support** – They pose as benefactors for radical causes—then quietly sabotage their success to turn public opinion.
  
- **Bribed Middlemen** – A charismatic gang leader gets a new weapon shipment… only to discover it was tracked. A reformist scholar receives a “donation” and is buried in scandal weeks later.

> Everyone knows what Lockjaw *really* does.  
> No one can prove it—and those who try get offered a job, a bribe, or a gravestone.

---

### 🔍 Player-Facing Themes:

- **Red Herrings** – Investigating one faction leads to another’s sabotage. Clues point to random actors—until the players start noticing a *pattern*.  
- **Network Unraveling** – Seemingly unrelated events (a blown bridge, a forged patent, a missing journalist) can all trace back to Lockjaw’s "favor economy."  
- **Hard Choices** – Taking down one faction just clears the board for another. Players must decide: dismantle the chaos, or find the hand feeding it?

> “No one trusts Lockjaw.  
> They just need them more than they hate them.”

---

### 🎭 The Illusion of Independence

Lockjaw makes every faction *feel* like they’re choosing their own destiny.  
But every choice was designed, every success predicted, and every rebellion pre-packaged with an expiration date.

>Copperview isn’t a city of factions.  
>It’s a stage.  
>And Lockjaw writes the endings.
