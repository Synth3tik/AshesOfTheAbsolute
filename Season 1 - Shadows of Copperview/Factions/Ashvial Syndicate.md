## Type  
Alchemical logistics front / black-market forgery cartel

## Location / Region  
Primarily The Crucible and Mirage Rise; presence in official records across all tiers

## Theme & Aesthetic  
The Ashvial Syndicate masks criminal infrastructure behind the skin of bureaucracy. They wear clean coats, press fake permits, and stir rotgut elixirs under lamplight. Their style leans clinical: surgical gloves, embossed satchels, civic-looking lanyards, and data-pads that might be genuine—or alchemically fabricated.

Their safehouses look like district offices. Their labs smell like ink, soot, and stale disinfectant.

## Philosophy & Goals  
- **Belief:** Legitimacy is a service, not a truth.  
- **Short-Term:** Maintain control over forged documents, transit clearances, and potion regulation through alchemical exclusivity.  
- **Long-Term:** Embed themselves so deeply into Copperview’s paperwork that purging them would collapse the city’s functionality.  
- **Self-View:** Quiet heroes making the system survivable.  
- **Outsider View:** Smug clerical parasites profiting off chaos and selling poison with a stamp.

## Key Figures  
- **Tannix Silt** – “Regional Coordinator.” A clean-shaven, copper-eyed goblin with the voice of a magistrate and the handshake of a smuggler. Handles internal arbitration and major forgery disputes. Speaks in clauses.  
- **Grilva "Dripfume" Korr** – Lead chemist and distributor of unsanctioned alchemicals. Known for her caustic elixirs and being able to tell your blood composition by scent alone.  
- **Archivist Nine** – An automaton made of metal scrolls and walking ink. Said to maintain the “Real Index,” a ledger of every forgery Ashvial has ever sold—just in case someone needs to disappear the original.

## Influence & Operations  
- Operate as a “logistics consultancy” with satellite offices throughout the Crucible and Mirage Rise.  
- Control significant portions of Copperview’s **permit registry black market**, including transit slips, inventor patents, residence records, and public grant documentation.  
- Distribute alchemical contraband via “official” delivery circuits, disguised under civic branding.  
- Offer services ranging from black-market healing draughts and identity alterations to synthetic death certificates.  
- Known for producing **ashvial inks**—alchemical reagents that bypass enchantment wards and document verification systems.

## Player Relationship  
- **Early:** The party may need their help to acquire forged identities, smuggled goods, or chemical treatments outside regulation.  
- **Mid:** Ashvial offers legitimacy in the form of paperwork—but at a cost. Players may find their actions retroactively legalized or criminalized depending on how their relationship with the syndicate develops.  
- **Late:** Ashvial could become either essential allies in unraveling bureaucratic blockades—or the ones rewriting truth itself to stop the party from reaching the top.

## Known Tactics  
- **Paper Weaponry:** Use of forged legal documents, fake bounty decrees, and artificial warrants to manipulate events without direct violence.  
- **Alchemy-by-Proxy:** Deploy chemical compounds that mimic status changes, illness, death, or mind-altering effects to render threats irrelevant without a fight.  
- **Disinformation Services:** Employ whispered narratives, faked archives, or altered public records to collapse reputations or hide movements.  
- **Shell Identity Nesting:** Create false trail identities—layered so thoroughly that even Lockjaw’s surveillance systems stall.

## Rumors & Hooks  
- A **real civic office** was unknowingly built atop an Ashvial forgery hub—and may now be complicit in hundreds of invisible crimes.  
- The **Real Index** is said to contain blackmail material on every major faction—including Lockjaw.  
- Tannix Silt has been meeting with **Whistletongue agents** about a merger between truth and forgery.  
- A dying Ashvial courier muttered “they’re using our seals to kill scholars” before evaporating into caustic smoke.

## Symbolism  
- **Primary Mark:** A stamped glass vial inside a civic document seal—always in ash-grey ink.  
- **Other Identifiers:** Copper paperclips shaped into knots, black-threaded sigil rings, or patch-laden courier coats.  
- **Internal Sayings:**  
  - “If it’s on paper, it’s real.”  
  - “Authority is what survives the inspection.”  
  - “Ink before iron.”
