## Phase 1: Foundational Worldbuilding Setup

_Focus on establishing the framework of Copperview – its concept, structure, and key references – before detailing specifics._

- **Establish the City’s Framework:** Create or finalize a high-level **index/landing page for Copperview’s regions** (Rustfloor, The Crucible, Mirage Rise, Pinnacle Row, etc.)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L4-L8). This index should briefly describe each tier of the city and provide links to their full write-ups. It will serve as a navigation hub and give an at-a-glance view of the city’s vertical layout.
    
- **Define Core Lore & Themes:** Write a concise **background lore overview** of Copperview. Cover how the city formed, any major historical events, and the origin of its tiered structure. Ensure this background aligns with the campaign’s tone and themes outlined in your overview (e.g. _“streetwise noir wrapped in unstable tech and goblin desperation”_[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Season%201%20-%20Overview/Shadows%20of%20Copperview%20%E2%80%93%20Campaign%20Overview.md#L6-L14), and themes like _Progress Through Collapse, Truth is Negotiable_[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Season%201%20-%20Overview/Shadows%20of%20Copperview%20%E2%80%93%20Campaign%20Overview.md#L34-L39)). This foundational lore will inform all location and faction development.
    
- **Audit Terminology & Links:** Double-check that all naming conventions and terms are consistent across documents. (For example, confirm that the old term “Ashworks” has been completely replaced by the new nomenclature in every file[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L8-L10).) As you do this, create internal links between related pages – link district names, factions, and NPCs wherever they are referenced[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L6-L8). This will knit the lore together and make navigation in your notes (especially Obsidian) easier.
    
- **Visualize Copperview’s Structure:** Draft a **vertical map or sketch** of Copperview’s tiered city structure[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L6-L9). Even a rough diagram showing Rustfloor at the bottom, the Crucible above it, up through Mirage Rise and Pinnacle Row (and the elusive Sealed Way) will help you and your players conceptualize the world. Mark key districts and how they stack or interconnect (e.g., major lifts or access points between layers). You can refine or beautify this map later, but establishing it now prevents spatial confusion.
    
- **Map Faction Influence Zones:** Alongside the city map, outline which **factions control or influence which areas**[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L8-L10). This could be a simple overlay on the city sketch or a list by district. (For example: Rustfloor is dominated by Rustblood Kin, Crucible has strong Iron Loop and Lockjaw presence, Mirage Rise sees Ledger Court and syndicates, etc.) This task clarifies the power dynamics geographically and will guide you when populating locations with faction content.
    
- **Confirm Campaign Scope:** Reiterate the planned **level range (1–5)** and expected season length (10–15 sessions)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Season%201%20-%20Overview/Shadows%20of%20Copperview%20%E2%80%93%20Campaign%20Overview.md#L20-L28) for yourself. This is just to ground your planning – it reminds you that the world depth should be appropriate for low-level characters initially, and which elements of the city might become relevant within this scope. (Higher-tier locations like Pinnacle Row or the Sealed Way might be more background in Season 1, whereas Rustfloor and Crucible will feature heavily.)
    

## Phase 2: Districts and Location Development

_Build out each district’s setting in the “Location Index” – describe environments, key locations, and local flavor, laying the groundwork where adventures will unfold._

- **Complete District Write-Ups:** Finish writing a **full overview for each major tier/district** of Copperview. Ensure **Rustfloor**, **The Crucible**, **Mirage Rise**, **Pinnacle Row**, and the **Sealed Way** (if it’s known or hinted at) each have a dedicated page. Include in each: a concise **description** capturing its atmosphere and role in the city, a list of typical **inhabitants** or denizens, and the **themes** or mood prevalent there (many of these are already started in your files). For example, Rustfloor’s page highlights its decaying, sacred machinery vibe and lists who lives there[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Rustfloor/Rustfloor.md#L5-L13)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Rustfloor/Rustfloor.md#L26-L30). Do similar for any district page that is still just a stub or outline.
    
- **Detail Key Locations per District:** Within each district page, flesh out the **major locations or landmarks** of that area. Many are already identified – e.g. Rustfloor’s key sites like _The Gullet, The Splitforge, The Socket Womb,_ etc. are enumerated with brief descriptions[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Rustfloor/Rustfloor.md#L34-L42)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Rustfloor/Rustfloor.md#L46-L54). Make sure each listed location has at least a short, flavorful blurb explaining what it is and why it’s notable. If a location is particularly important or complex (like a dungeon or central hub), consider giving it its own sub-page with a more detailed write-up (as was done with _The Faultline_[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Rustfloor/Rustfloor.md#L76-L84)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Rustfloor/The%20Faultline.md#L8-L16)). In The Crucible, for instance, ensure places like _Checkpoint Ironjaw, The Threadline, Spillgate Terminal,_ and _The Railhusk_ are all outlined with their purpose and what characters might do or find there[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/The%20Crucible/The%20Crucible.md#L34-L42)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/The%20Crucible/The%20Crucible.md#L54-L62).
    
- **Fill in Minor Locations (Sparingly):** Add a section for **minor locations or points of interest** in each district, but keep these to a sentence or two each. These could be small shops, back-alleys, or local oddities that add flavor (e.g., Rustfloor’s _Shattercap Stacks_ tenements or the echo chamber _Whinepipe Hollow_[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Rustfloor/Rustfloor.md#L86-L95)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Rustfloor/Rustfloor.md#L124-L132)). They’re useful for impromptu scenes or side hooks, but you don’t need to deeply detail every one – just enough that you can improvise if needed.
    
- **Verify Faction Presence in Districts:** On each district page, review the **“Factions Present”** list and update if necessary[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Rustfloor/Rustfloor.md#L18-L23)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/The%20Crucible/The%20Crucible.md#L18-L24). Ensure it matches your current understanding of faction territories. If, for example, the **Lockjaw Syndicate** or **Iron Loop** should officially appear in a district’s list, add them. Likewise, remove any faction that no longer fits if your concept has changed. These lists help quickly identify who the power players are in any given area (and will later help when deciding which NPCs and conflicts to highlight there).
    
- **Integrate Cross-References:** As you finalize location write-ups, **link relevant pages to each other**. For instance, if a location description mentions a faction or NPC, use the wiki-style link to their page (the way Rustfloor’s text links [[The Crucible]] above and factions like [[Coil-Eaters]] in context[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Rustfloor/Rustfloor.md#L8-L15)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Rustfloor/Rustfloor.md#L18-L21)). This not only helps navigation but reminds you to ensure those other pages (faction, NPC, etc.) have information consistent with the mention. If a key location is tied to a faction (e.g., a Hollow Deck gambling den in Mirage Rise), you might also note that under the faction’s page.
    
- **Establish Environmental and Social Details:** For each district, jot down notes on the **day-to-day life and environment**: What do the streets look, sound, and smell like? How do people survive there? This may be partly covered in your descriptions, but also think in terms of gameplay – e.g., “Mirage Rise is crowded with markets and legal offices, so public scenes might involve fast-talking merchants or contract disputes.” These details will help you create dynamic encounters later. Burnstack Commons, for example, has details like the constant machinery hum and soot-slicked workers which give a clear mental image[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/The%20Crucible/Burnstack%20Commons.md#L9-L17)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/The%20Crucible/Burnstack%20Commons.md#L30-L38). Aim for a similar level of immersive detail in each main district page.
    
- **Dynamic District Events:** Identify one or two **ambient events or challenges** unique to each district that can occur without player initiation. For example, in Rustfloor perhaps a section of scaffolding collapses or a sacred machine belches toxic fumes periodically; in the Crucible, maybe a scheduled pressure release causes a mini-quake or a checkpoint goes on lockdown unexpectedly. These will contribute to the _living world_ feel. You can list these as bullet points under a “Hooks/Incidents” section (some pages already include **“Player Hooks & Encounters”** or similar ideas[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/The%20Crucible/Burnstack%20Commons.md#L54-L61)). They need not all be used, but having them prepared means you can inject activity at any time to show the city’s ecosystem in motion.
    

## Phase 3: Factions and Power Dynamics

_Develop each faction in depth and map out the political landscape. Clearly understand each group’s identity, aims, and relationships to bring the city’s power struggles to life._

- **Finalize All Faction Profiles:** Ensure every major faction in the _Factions_ directory has a **complete profile page**. By now, many are already written in detail (e.g. **Rustblood Kin**, **Coil-Eaters**, **Iron Loop**, **Fracture Union**, **Lockjaw Syndicate**, **Ashvial Syndicate**, **Hollow Deck**, **Ledger Court**, **Whistletongue Cabal**, **Crownspire Trust**, **Glazeline**, **Velvetwork**, **Coiled Bloom**, **Glitzgarde**, etc.). Do a pass on each to verify no sections are left as placeholders. Each page should include: the faction’s **type and aesthetic**, their **philosophy/ideology**, key **goals**, notable **key figures or leaders**, how they typically **operate**, and any unique **tactics or methods** they use. (For example, the Iron Loop page defines their culture and has short-term/long-term goals plus key figures like Brakeboss Marrin[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Factions/Iron%20Loop.md#L12-L20), while the Lockjaw page lists its inner circle “Jawline” members like Karn Trosk and others[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Factions/Lockjaw%20Syndicate.md#L58-L66)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Factions/Lockjaw%20Syndicate.md#L68-L76).) Align the detail level across factions so none of the important ones feel underdeveloped compared to others.
    
- **State Faction Goals (Short & Long Term):** In each faction profile, explicitly state their **short-term objectives** (what are they trying to achieve _right now_ or in Season 1?) and **long-term ambitions** (what’s their endgame or guiding star?)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L16-L19). Many profiles already include this in a “Philosophy & Goals” or similar section – for instance, Rustblood Kin’s entry lists a short-term goal of reclaiming relic sites and a long-term goal of tearing down the false layers of the city[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Factions/Rustblood%20Kin.md#L13-L19). Ensure every faction, even social ones like Glazeline or Velvetwerk, has something like this noted. These agendas will drive the faction’s behavior and give you dynamic plot fuel. If any faction page is missing clear goals, add a bullet list or paragraph to outline them.
    
- **Create a Faction Relationship Matrix:** Make a simple reference that charts **faction relationships** at a glance[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L16-L19). This could be a table or just a list of notes, but capture who is allied vs. opposed. You’ve written each faction’s relationship to the Lockjaw Syndicate in the overview (e.g. Whistletongue Cabal is ignored by Lockjaw, Ledger Court is a public ally but a private rival[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Factions/Factions%20-%20Overview.md#L101-L108)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Factions/Factions%20-%20Overview.md#L113-L121), etc.), which is great. Expand on this by noting inter-faction relations: for example, **Iron Loop** might conflict with **Fracture Union** (since one maintains infrastructure and the other sabotages it), **Ashvial** likely covertly works with Lockjaw to some extent, **Crownspire Trust** and **Glazeline** probably have symbiotic relationships, etc. This matrix will be a handy cheat-sheet when roleplaying faction interactions or planning how one faction might react if another gains an advantage. (Consider including a brief note like “Faction A distrusts Faction B because X” for each relevant pair.)
    
- **Plan Faction Shake-ups:** Decide which factions will undergo **major changes during the campaign** to simulate an evolving political landscape[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L17-L20). Identify 1–2 factions that are likely to _collapse, merge, or dramatically shift allegiance_ in Season 1. For example, perhaps the **Fracture Union** is on its last legs and will be destroyed or absorbed by another group as part of the story, or maybe an extremist splinter of **Rustblood Kin** breaks off. Maybe one of the Mirage Rise factions (like the Whistletongue Cabal or Ledger Court) gets exposed or ousted from power, creating a power vacuum. Flag these possibilities now and jot down a few conditions or triggers for them (e.g. “if the party exposes X or if Y event happens, Faction Z will fall apart”). This foresight lets you foreshadow these shifts in the worldbuilding phase (through rumors or unstable NPC behavior) so they feel earned and natural when they happen.
    
- **Embed Factions into Locations & Narrative:** Revisit the **location pages** and ensure faction presence is reflected in the descriptions of key sites (many already do this by listing which faction operates where). If a faction has a “home base” or signature location, double-check that location is described (for instance, the **Ledger Court’s** arbitration chamber at Binder’s Court in Mirage Rise[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/Mirage%20Rise/Mirage%20Rise.md#L33-L41), or the **Hollow Deck** running gambling dens like the Ember Knot in the Crucible[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/The%20Crucible/Burnstack%20Commons.md#L70-L75)). Also think ahead about **faction-driven subplots**: for each faction, consider one dynamic thing they might do _during_ play independent of the main murder arc (e.g. Iron Loop staging a protest against Lockjaw policy, Coil-Eaters spreading a hallucinogenic meme in graffiti, etc.). Note these ideas under the faction’s profile or in a separate “faction clock” list. They will help make the city feel alive, as factions will pursue these side agendas in the background (or foreground) while the PCs investigate the core mystery.
    

## Phase 4: NPC Creation and Integration

_Populate the world with a cast of characters. Focus first on those most crucial to early sessions, then flesh out additional personalities to enrich each locale. Integrate NPCs with their factions and locations to reinforce the world’s coherence._

- **Build a Master NPC Index:** Create an **NPC index page** (if one doesn’t exist yet) that lists all significant NPCs alphabetically or by category[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L23-L28). Each entry should have a very brief tag or note: e.g., “**Karn Trosk –** Lockjaw Syndicate Chancellor (Copperview’s de facto ruler)” or “**Brakeboss Marrin –** Iron Loop checkpoint commander at Ironjaw Gate.” This index will let you quickly find characters during prep or play. It will also highlight if any notable roles are missing an NPC (for example, if you realize you have no named figure for a certain faction or district, you can create one). Make sure to **tag each NPC with their faction and home district** in this list for easy reference.
    
- **Define Key Early-Game NPCs:** Prioritize writing full profiles for the NPCs the party is most likely to meet in the first few sessions[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L25-L32). These include:
    
    - **Brakeboss Marrin:** The Field Marshal of Checkpoint Ironjaw, and a high-ranking member of Iron Loop[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Factions/Iron%20Loop.md#L18-L23). He’s essentially the “face” of Copperview’s entry bureaucracy. Detail Marrin’s personality (e.g. gruff and by-the-book or corrupt and bribe-friendly?), his goals (maybe keeping the peace at the gate or skimming profits), and how he’ll interact with newcomers. He could be an early quest-giver or obstacle.
        
    - **Saltwhistle Cray:** (Likely mentioned in your notes but not yet detailed.) Define who Saltwhistle Cray is. Perhaps he’s an information broker in Mirage Rise or a local fixer in the Rustfloor – the name has a roguish flair. Give him a faction or allegiance (maybe tied to the Whistletongue Cabal or Ashvial Syndicate) and a reason the PCs might encounter him (e.g. he could offer clues about the murder for a price, or be a supplier of illicit goods). Write a short backstory and a couple of personality traits (e.g. jovial gossipmonger hiding a cunning streak).
        
    - **Bail Hosk:** (Also referenced but not detailed yet.) Decide Bail Hosk’s role. Perhaps Hosk is a detective in the Lockjaw Syndicate’s enforcer corps, or a disgraced engineer from the Crucible who has info on the murders. His name suggests a tough, no-nonsense character. Flesh out his connection to the plot – he might be investigating parallel to the PCs or could be a suspect. Note his demeanor and any quirks (maybe he’s surprisingly principled for a Copperview official, or alternatively, paranoid and jumpy from seeing too much).
        
    - **Solin Vale / Valis Blume:** Choose which of these two will act as the **grieving academic who hires the party** to investigate the murder (or delineate both if they might appear in different scenarios)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L27-L30). Develop that NPC’s profile: their field of study, relationship to the murdered innkeeper, and why they’re desperate enough to hire outsiders. For example, Solin Vale might be a scholar of urban myths who realizes the symbolic pattern in the killings, whereas Valis Blume might be an alchemist who supplied the innkeeper with something important. Give whichever one you use a sympathetic motive and helpful contacts or knowledge to assist the party. Also prepare how they behave under stress – since as the plot unfolds, this NPC might become a target or reveal secrets.
        
- **Populate Each Faction/District with Supporting NPCs:** Once the critical NPCs are handled, create **additional NPCs to populate the world**, especially for factions and locations that will feature in play. You don’t need full write-ups for all of these, but have a **list of names, roles, and one-liners**. For example: a Rustblood Kin war-priest who oversees _The Gullet_ furnace-temple, a Glitzgarde captain who enforces glamour-laws in Pinnacle Row, a Hollow Deck bookie running a back-alley dice game, an Ashvial Syndicate chemist in the Crucible’s black markets, etc. Aim to have at least 1–2 NPCs noted per major faction and per key location. These can be introduced as needed to make the world feel lived-in. If any of them become important, you can expand their notes later.
    
- **Red Herrings and False Suspects:** Deliberately design a few NPCs who will serve as **red herrings in the murder investigation**[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L29-L31). These characters should each have something that makes them look _possibly guilty_ or suspicious in-game. For instance: a nervous apprentice who was seen near the crime scene carrying a bloody rag (but it turns out to be unrelated), or a rival innkeeper who had public feuds with the victim (but is ultimately innocent of _this_ crime). Write a short note on each suspect NPC’s motive or secret (even if it’s not murder, they should have something to hide). During play, these characters can divert the party’s attention, deepen the mystery, or even become side-quests. Be careful to ensure their subplots resolve logically so the players feel satisfied that they truly _ruled them out_.
    
- **Link NPCs to Factions and Locations:** Go back through your location and faction pages and **embed NPC names wherever appropriate**, now that you have them defined. For example, if Brakeboss Marrin is the Iron Loop boss at Checkpoint Ironjaw, the Crucible page’s description of that checkpoint can mention him by name as the overseer. Similarly, faction pages that list “Key Figures” (many already do) should include these NPCs with a brief epithet (e.g. Iron Loop’s page might list Brakeboss Marrin as a key figure if not already, and Lockjaw’s inner circle list includes Karn Trosk, etc.). This cross-referencing reinforces the network of who runs what in the city. It will also help you quickly find an NPC if, say, the party decides to seek out the local Ashvial boss – you’ll have that name on the faction or district page.
    
- **Ensure NPC Motivations Mesh with World:** For each major NPC, double-check that their personal goals or fears tie into the larger lore you’ve built. For example, Karn “Golden Knuckles” Trosk’s profile shows his goals and secrets that tie directly into Lockjaw’s stranglehold on the city[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/NPC%20Directory/Karn%20%E2%80%9CGolden%20Knuckles%E2%80%9D%20Trosk.md#L42-L50)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/NPC%20Directory/Karn%20%E2%80%9CGolden%20Knuckles%E2%80%9D%20Trosk.md#L50-L58). Do this with your NPCs: if one is a Coil-Eater prophet, ensure their ramblings include references to the city’s “pattern” or other lore from the Coil-Eater faction info. If one is an academic, give them opinions on the city’s failing systems or faction philosophies. These touches make NPCs feel like products of the environment.
    

## Phase 5: Narrative Structure and Story Integration

_With a rich world now built, design the storyline and how it will unfold within this setting. Outline the campaign’s progression, ensuring that it leverages the world’s dynamics and remains flexible. Focus on the mystery plot, key events, and how the living world responds to the players’ actions (or inaction)._

- **Refine the Core Mystery and Lore Ties:** Revisit the central **Season 1 conflict – the series of symbolic murders** – and make sure you have a solid grasp on **who** is behind them and **why**. Document the culprit or conspiracy’s endgoal and how it connects to the world’s themes (e.g. is it an ideological crusade? A faction’s secret project? Something to do with the “new philosophy” spreading in the city[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Season%201%20-%20Overview/Shadows%20of%20Copperview%20%E2%80%93%20Campaign%20Overview.md#L34-L39)?). For instance, if an emerging movement or cult is orchestrating the murders to send a message, clarify what that message is. Decide on the **symbolic elements of each murder** (maybe each victim represents a facet of Copperview’s corruption that the killers want to expose, hence the “suspiciously clean” murder scene as a calling card)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Season%201%20-%20Overview/Shadows%20of%20Copperview%20%E2%80%93%20Campaign%20Overview.md#L28-L35)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L50-L54). By nailing down these details, you ensure the clues you plant in the worldbuilding (texts, graffiti, NPC dialogue) can consistently point toward the truth without needing to retcon later.
    
- **Outline Campaign Arc & Acts:** Break the season’s storyline into a **rough sequence or acts**. For example: **Act I** – Introduction and first clues (the party arrives, investigates the first murder); **Act II** – Escalation (murders continue, multiple factions get involved, perhaps a second tier of the city opens up to the PCs as they follow leads); **Act III** – Revelation and Confrontation (discovering the movement behind it and a showdown to stop the next catastrophic event). Write a short synopsis of each act, noting key plot points and which locations or factions will be central in that phase. This high-level outline will help identify what content needs to be ready by when. If Act II sends the PCs into Mirage Rise’s politics, you’ll want Mirage Rise fully fleshed out by then, etc. Use your world’s features to your advantage: maybe Act II has a chase or investigation that moves vertically (from the Crucible down to Rustfloor or up to Mirage Rise), showcasing the city’s literal depth.
    
- **Prepare Session 0 Topics:** Plan a **Session 0 discussion agenda**[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L35-L39) to align expectations with your players. In your notes, list the key themes and setting norms to communicate: for instance, “Copperview is a volatile goblin metropolis – expect intrigue, moral ambiguity, and a mix of noir and industrial fantasy.” Emphasize the **tone** (gutter-level, con-artist noir), the notion of **vertical stratification** (the higher you go, the more power – and the more absurd the decadence), and that **alliances will shift** and **truth is hard to pin down**. Also outline any custom rules or safety tools relevant to these themes, and check if players want to tie their backstories to any factions or districts (if they do, you’ll incorporate that into world details). Essentially, Session 0 is where you make sure the players are on board with the kind of world you built, so write down the points you absolutely need them to know or buy into.
    
- **Design Session 1 (Campaign Kickoff):** Plot the key beats of the **opening session**[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L40-L44). Start the party **in media res** if possible to grab attention. Ideas for Session 1: The PCs arrive in Copperview via the **Winding Descent** (if that’s a physical spiral rail or road into the city) and immediately face a choice or conflict that introduces the setting’s stakes. Perhaps at **Checkpoint Ironjaw**, they must deal with Iron Loop inspectors and witness a tense standoff between factions (e.g. a Rustfloor refugee family being harassed by a Lockjaw official, giving the PCs a chance to intervene and make a faction impression early)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/The%20Crucible/The%20Crucible.md#L36-L44)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Location%20Index/The%20Crucible/The%20Crucible.md#L46-L50). Then, have the **inciting incident** occur: maybe they find out an innkeeper was murdered (their prospective employer’s friend, or simply a local figure) and are asked to look into it. Include an **introductory combat or skill challenge** that highlights the environment – e.g., a brawl or chase through a crowded, multi-level marketplace in the Crucible or Rustfloor. By the end of Session 1, aim for the party to have a couple of leads to pursue (each potentially tied to different factions or districts) and a clear hook that “something bigger is happening” beyond just one death. Write these beats as a bullet list so you can adjust pacing as needed.
    
- **Develop Modular Incident Scenes:** Create 3–5 **“floating” encounters or vignettes** that you can drop in at appropriate moments, regardless of the district[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L42-L45). These incidents should showcase the city’s living nature and themes. For example: _a sudden industrial accident_ (like a crane collapse or pipe explosion) that the players can choose to help with or exploit; _a street demonstration or riot_ led by a faction agitator (perhaps a Glitzgarde unit disperses Rustfloor protestors with excessive flair); _an enigmatic Coil-Eater sermon_ in a public square that causes unrest; _a con artist’s scam_ unfolding in front of the PCs, etc. Each incident should involve a quick decision or challenge and reveal a snippet of lore or raise a question. Prepare the basic setup and outcome for each, but keep them flexible – you’ll insert them wherever the pacing calls for an extra push or whenever the players wander the streets looking for trouble.
    
- **Map Clues and Leads to Factions:** Now that you know the trajectory of the mystery, go through each **faction and major location** and decide if there’s a clue or piece of information the PCs could learn there. Essentially, populate your clue web: for instance, if a particular murder victim had ties to the **Ashvial Syndicate**, maybe an Ashvial contact can reveal that victim’s last transaction; if the Coil-Eaters predicted the pattern, perhaps graffiti in Coil-Tangle Alley contains a hidden message. Write down at least one **lead or clue** associated with each major faction or district that you expect the players to interact with. This not only helps tie the story into the world, it also ensures multiple pathways to discover the truth (so the investigation doesn’t stall). Make sure clues are distributed such that no single path is mandatory – the players might miss one, but catch another. The goal is a robust investigative sandbox where the world itself holds the answers if the PCs dig in the right places.
    
- **Plan Faction Reactions and Timetable:** Outline a **timeline of events** that will happen as the mystery progresses, assuming the PCs don’t prevent them. This is key for a dynamic world[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Season%201%20-%20Overview/Shadows%20of%20Copperview%20%E2%80%93%20Campaign%20Overview.md#L42-L46). For example: if no one stops it, maybe every 3-4 days another murder occurs, each in a different district and with escalating impact. Mark when each murder or major incident is “scheduled” to happen in the background story. Also script how different factions will react as things heat up: perhaps after the second murder, **Lockjaw Syndicate** declares a curfew in one district; after the third, **Iron Loop** starts guarding checkpoints more tightly; if the players get evidence against a faction, that faction might send agents to destroy the evidence or silence witnesses, etc. Essentially, decide what the **world’s response** is at various milestones of the plot. This timeline of faction actions helps you portray a world that isn’t waiting idly for the heroes – it is moving forward, for better or worse. You can then weave these developments into session planning (e.g., “Session 3 will open with news of a second murder in Mirage Rise; the Ledger Court is convening an emergency session as a result”).
    
- **Design the Climactic Confrontation:** Think ahead to the end of Season 1 and sketch out the possible **finale scenarios**. Depending on player choices, the climax could be a direct showdown with the main culprit (maybe in a dramatic location like atop a rickety Pinnacle Row platform or deep in Rustfloor’s ancient vault), _or_ it could be the PCs orchestrating factions to stop a city-wide catastrophe (like preventing a revolutionary riot or shutting down a sabotaged machine). Outline two or three likely outcomes: e.g., “If the party sides with Faction A, ending plays out as X; if they side with Faction B or go it alone, outcome Y,” etc. Also consider the aftermath: which factions will be weakened or empowered by the way things end? This forward-thinking will guide how you portray those factions in earlier phases (so you can set up the possibility of those outcomes). You don’t need this in detail now, but having a general idea ensures that as you flesh out content in Phases 1–4, you’re seeding elements that support a satisfying payoff.
    

## Phase 6: Final Touches – Mechanics and Immersion

_Add the finishing tools to enhance gameplay and immersion. These tasks ensure the world you built translates smoothly into a fun play experience, with clear mechanics where needed and rich sensory details for the players._

- **Establish Custom Mechanics (Lightly):** Determine if any **house rules or system tweaks** are needed to reflect Copperview’s unique environment and tone[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L57-L61). Keep these minimal, as the focus is narrative, but consider things like: a **reputation system** with factions (perhaps using a simple tracker for each major faction to record the party’s standing), or rules for **bribery and bartering influence** (maybe quick skill challenge frameworks or advantage/disadvantage guidelines when leveraging a favor). If the noir aspect is important, you might implement a **vice or stress mechanic** (borrowing lightly from something like Blades in the Dark) to track how the city wears on the party over time. Outline these ideas and decide which ones will genuinely add to the experience. Before play, write a short document for players on any new rules (so Session 1 doesn’t bog down explaining them).
    
- **Prepare GM Quick-Reference Tools:** Create or compile a few **rollable tables or cheat-sheets** for on-the-fly details[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L60-L65). Possibilities include:
    
    - A **Rumor Table**: 10–20 one-line rumors that NPCs in bars or streets might share. Mix trivial flavor (e.g. “Someone’s been stealing the gear-teeth from the Rustfloor shrines”) with useful leads (“They say an official was found dead _too clean_ – like the dirt was just gone”) and red herrings.
        
    - An **NPC Personality/Mood Table**: Quick descriptors to improv distinct goblin NPC attitudes (e.g. jaded, twitchy, grandiose, paranoid, obsequious, etc.), maybe paired with a quirk (“keeps coughing up soot”, “constantly adjusts their monocle”, “refers to themselves in third person”). This helps bring minor NPCs to life if the party has unexpected interactions.
        
    - A **District Event Table**: For each district, a small table of ambient happenings. For example, in Rustfloor: 1d6 events like “Rustblood Kin initiation duel spills onto the street” or “power outage – everything goes dark, chants in the distance”. In Mirage Rise: “impromptu contract duel between lawyers draws a crowd”, etc. These can be used as filler or to add texture when players traverse those areas.

    - A **Clue Generator or Twist Table** (optional): If the investigation stalls, a table of ways to nudge them – e.g. “Old contact delivers a message”, “A piece of evidence surfaces in the black market”, etc., with which faction or district it ties to.  
    Having these prepared will reduce cognitive load during sessions and keep the pace up. (If you use Obsidian, you can implement these as **rollable dice tables** for quick access[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L62-L65).)

- **Create Visual Aids (Maps & Handouts):** Even though this is worldbuilding-focused, plan out any **visual aids** you want alongside the narrative. High on the list is a **city map or schematic**: since Copperview is vertical, a side-on cross-sectional map could be extremely helpful for players. You might create a simple version yourself or commission an artist once your design is set[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L70-L72). Also consider **district maps** or at least key location diagrams if there are areas the players will navigate tactically (for instance, a map of a convoluted Rustfloor scrap battlefield or a Mirage Rise marketplace might be handy). For now, note which maps you’ll need so you can either draw them or source them before the game.

- In-world handouts: Plan a few **immersive handouts or props**[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/%F0%9F%93%8B%20Campaign%20Prep%20%E2%80%93%20To-Do%20List.md#L68-L73). These could be physical prints or digital images representing: a torn **flyer or manifesto** from the antagonists (with cryptic messaging that foreshadows their ideology), a **newspaper clipping or broadsheet** about the murders or faction conflicts (to show how events are being spun publicly), **permits or licenses** (Lockjaw-issued documents the players might acquire or forge), or even a **letter from an NPC**. Think about moments in the story where a tangible clue would excite the players and try to prepare something for those. Since Copperview has a strong aesthetic (industrial, gritty, with bits of glamour), making a couple of documents that reflect that (sooty paper, elegant Pinnacle letterhead stained with oil, etc.) will deepen immersion.

- **Safety and Theme Checks:** Review the content you’ve created for any themes that might need a **safety discussion** with players (e.g. if your world includes elements like oppression, body horror with mechanical implants, cult behavior, etc., you should be ready to address lines and veils for those topics). This isn’t a worldbuilding detail per se, but it’s part of final prep to ensure that the rich details you’ve added enhance the game and don’t unexpectedly cause issues. List these topics and handle them in Session 0.

- **Final Consistency Pass:** Do a thorough read-through of all your worldbuilding documents (factions, locations, NPCs, overview) for **consistency and coherence**. Ensure names of people and places remain the same across pages (unify any mismatches), confirm timelines line up (e.g., if an NPC is said to be “older than the city’s last collapse” in one place, make sure that fits with your history elsewhere), and check that every faction’s portrayal is uniform (if the Ashvial Syndicate is professional in one description but called “rabble” in another, decide which it is or in what context). Look for any **loose threads** that you added in creative frenzy but haven’t integrated (such as a mysterious [[Unknown]] entity mentioned in Coil-Eaters lore[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Factions/Coil-Eaters.md#L2-L9)[github.com](https://github.com/Synth3tik/AshesOfTheAbsolute/blob/20fdaa4c0022b89d1f3444ba308abe992736ee2d/Season%201%20-%20Shadows%20of%20Copperview/Factions/Coil-Eaters.md#L27-L35) – if it’s important, keep it, if not, consider removing or downplaying it to avoid confusing the players). It’s fine if some world mysteries remain for you to use later, just make sure they’re not so prominent that they distract from the current campaign’s scope.

- **Prioritize Play-Relevant Content:** As a concluding step, prioritize which content must be 100% ready before the campaign starts, versus what can be left as a stub to fill in later. For example, **Rustfloor, Crucible, and Mirage Rise** (and their major locations and NPCs) likely need to be fully fleshed out now, because early adventures will roam there. **Pinnacle Row or the Sealed Way** details might be lower priority if they come into play only in late-season or not at all – you could leave some notes and refine those when the campaign trajectory heads upward. It’s okay if not everything in the world is written to the same depth right away, as long as you’ve covered the foundations and the expected focal points. Make a short list for yourself of “Must-finish before Session 1” and “Nice-to-have for later” so you can manage your prep time efficiently.

- **Maintain the Living World:** Once play begins, continue updating the to-do list or campaign log with changes that occur due to player action. The world is meant to feel alive and coherent, so be ready to adjust your plans and notes as factions react dynamically to the heroes. Keep notes on evolving faction standings (if the party earns Iron Loop’s trust, mark that; if they trash a Glitzgarde operation, note the retaliation brewing, etc.). This isn’t a one-time task, but an ongoing practice: regularly prune and update your notes so the written world state remains an accurate, logical reflection of the in-game reality. This way, the next time you step to plan a session, you’re working from an up-to-date world model, and the campaign will maintain internal consistency and vibrancy throughout Season 1.
