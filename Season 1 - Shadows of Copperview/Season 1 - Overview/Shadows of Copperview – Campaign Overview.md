## Campaign Title  

**Shadows of Copperview**

## Campaign Tone/Genre  

A volatile, gutter-level pseudo-noir where every goblin thinks they’re one scheme away from greatness—or explosion. Copperview runs on scams, ego, and back-alley philosophy. It’s a city of broken systems and brilliant failures, where ideas spread like infections and loyalty lasts only as long as the payout.  

Tension comes from everyone pulling a con—politicians, inventors, gang bosses, even the thinkers. Ideology is currency, truth is a sales pitch, and survival depends on how fast you talk when things go wrong. It’s messy, fast-paced, and constantly on the edge of collapse.  

Think: streetwise noir wrapped in unstable tech and goblin desperation.

## Primary Setting (Region/City)  

[[Copperview]] — a colossal, layered goblin metropolis carved from a massive copper vein. It's a vertical madhouse of criminal empires, rogue academics, arcane engineers, broken infrastructure, and fractured ideologies. Every goblin thinks they’re five steps from greatness—or self-inflicted immolation.

The city runs on three things: invention, reputation, and hustle. Crime syndicates operate like corporations. Universities are battlegrounds for theory and sabotage. You don’t survive Copperview by being honest—you survive by being useful.

## Season 1 Level Range  

Levels 1–5

## Expected Number of Sessions  

10–15

## Season 1 Core Conflict  

A well-known innkeeper is found murdered under suspiciously clean conditions. The party is hired by a grieving academic to investigate. One death leads to many, and each murder becomes more symbolic, precise, and untraceable—like pieces being placed by an unseen hand. As the party digs deeper, they begin to see patterns: unrest rising, factions mobilizing, and truths being twisted.

They are not chasing a killer. They are chasing a movement—one that’s already begun.

## Major Themes  

- **Progress Through Collapse** – Copperview doesn’t fear destruction. It calls it iteration.  
- **Truth is Negotiable** – Everyone sells a version of it. Some versions are weaponized.  
- **Ideological Contagion** – A new philosophy is spreading, promising transcendence through struggle.  
- **Stratified Madness** – The deeper you go—literally and philosophically—the more unhinged things become.


## Campaign Premise  

The players arrive in Copperview under the premise of solving a murder. They quickly realize the killing was just the first domino in a larger pattern. Someone—or something—is engineering tension in the city, curating conflict between factions, and turning academic ideals into revolution slogans. The players are drawn in as pawns, witnesses, or accidental catalysts.

What they do will determine whether Copperview survives or becomes a spark in something much larger.

## Region Focus – Vertical Hierarchy of Copperview  

Copperview is a tower of ambition and rot. The deeper you go, the older, poorer, and more unstable life becomes. But the real power is up above—where glass floors cover old sins, and gold-plated machines hum behind polished propaganda.

### Rustfloor

**Location:** Copperview’s lowest inhabited tier, buried beneath the Crucible.  

**Tone:** Feral, sacred, decaying. A place the city pretends doesn’t exist.  

**Description:**  
Rustfloor is a collapsing sprawl of sacred scrap heaps, dead machines, and ancestral fumes. To outsiders, it’s a dumping ground. To those who remain, it’s the city’s true heart—older than Lockjaw, louder than ideology. Goblin clans rule through ritual, steel, and endurance, with rust-wrapped cults and whisper-sick prophets claiming purpose in the wreckage.

**Factions Present:**  
- Rustblood Kin – brutal tech-shamans and ancestral war-clans  
- Coil-Eaters – conspiracy cult infected by buried ideology  
- Lockjaw Syndicate – tolerated when bribed, ambushed when not  
- Iron Loop – uses lower rails; constantly sabotaged  
- Fracture Union – broken cells hiding in dead infrastructure  

**Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Ancient tech, hidden philosophies, and explosive tribal tension  
- Getting in is hard. Getting out with allies is harder.

### The Crucible

**Location:** Copperview’s industrial threshold — the lowest "official" layer before things fall off the grid.

**Tone:** Loud, choked, overbuilt. Sparks fly, pressure hisses, and nothing runs clean.

**Description:**  
The Crucible is Copperview’s bottleneck—a furnace of smog, sweat, and half-fixed infrastructure. It's the entry point for anyone crawling down from the surface, and the first real taste of how broken the system is. All roads from the outside funnel through the **[[The Winding Descent]]**, a fractured cliffside path that ends at **Checkpoint Ironjaw**—an overloaded customs node run by whoever has the leverage that week.  

Rail hubs scream overhead, factory-fortresses belch light, and every walkway doubles as a checkpoint, blockade, or protest route.

**Factions Present:**  
- Iron Loop – logistics syndicate and checkpoint controllers  
- Fracture Union – shattered resistance group hiding in scaffolds  
- Ashvial Syndicate – smugglers, alchemists, and document forgers  
- Lockjaw Syndicate – present via regulation offices and “civic audits”  
- Glitzgarde – show up for unrest, leave in costume changes

**Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Faction chokehold on incoming traffic at Checkpoint Ironjaw  
- Black-market documents, sabotage, or stolen freight routes  
- The wrong smile in the right queue can get someone killed

### Mirage Rise

**Location:** Mid-tier Copperview — the city’s economic engine, where information, influence, and coin all change hands faster than laws can keep up.

**Tone:** Frenzied, performative, over-leveraged. Everyone’s selling something, especially their silence.

**Description:**  
Mirage Rise is Copperview’s marketplace of ambition. Everything has a price here—trust, safety, even names. Open-air courts blur with auction floors. Rooftop lounges double as espionage nests. Truth isn’t hidden; it’s simply bid on. Mid-tier factions clash quietly, each trying to rise without being seen climbing.

**Factions Present:**  
- Ledger Court – bureaucratic debt cult enforcing fiscal law  
- Whistletongue Cabal – whispered network trading in dangerous truths  
- Hollow Deck – gambling syndicate with presence at every tier  
- Ashvial Syndicate – chemical smugglers and document fixers with a clean front  
- Lockjaw Syndicate – keeps its fingers here, but lets others draw the ink

**Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Trials decided by whose briefcase is heavier  
- Information traded like smuggled goods  
- Murders staged to look like bankruptcies—and vice versa


---

### Pinnacle Row

**Location:** Copperview’s highest public tier — a skyline of curated power, where indulgence is law and failure is a costume change.

**Tone:** Velvet, chrome, and chemical perfection. Everything here is polished—until you scratch the surface.

**Description:**  
Pinnacle Row is Copperview’s dreamscape for the rich and ruthless. It’s where ideology wears a tailored suit, and pleasure is just another kind of leverage. Factions don’t rule here through force—they rule through clout, beauty, addiction, and narrative control. Reputation is wealth. Visibility is survival.  

The higher you go, the more unspoken the violence becomes.

**Factions Present:**  
- Glazeline – pastel-coded influencers who control what (and who) is visible  
- Coiled Bloom – elite neuropharma syndicate offering emotional “optimization”  
- Crownspire Trust – civic leisure barons turning spas into power arenas  
- Velvetwork – companionship front for intelligence manipulation  
- Glitzgarde – aesthetic enforcers keeping dissent off-brand  
- Lockjaw Syndicate – the quiet landlords of the system everyone here pretends doesn’t exist

**Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Parties that decide political fates mid-toast  
- Identity-altering therapy that deletes inconvenient memories  
- Betrayal broadcast as art installation


---

### The Sealed Way

**Location:** The highest tier—if it exists at all.

**Tone:** Cold, silent, preserved. Like memory under glass.

**Description:**  
The Sealed Way isn’t on any official map. Some say it was locked shut before the first sparks of Copperview were struck. Others say it was never built—only installed. Those who speak of it describe **white corridors**, **sealed elevators**, and **watchful silence**. No one who goes looking for it finds it twice the same way.

It is either the city’s final lie… or its original truth.

**Factions Present:**  
None—at least, none that admit it.

**Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Access may require erasing your identity, history, or name from city records  
- The first murders may mirror ancient patterns tied to a forgotten civic doctrine  
- The Sealed Way may not be a place at all—but an ideological firewall to keep the city from remembering

The case leads them into the underbelly of the city, where the lines between truth, manipulation, and ideology blur. As they uncover more, the city destabilizes around them—and their choices might just push it over the edge.
