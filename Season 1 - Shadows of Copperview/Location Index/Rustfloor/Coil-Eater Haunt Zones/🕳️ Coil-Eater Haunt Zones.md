## 🧷 Overview

The [[Coil-Eaters]] don’t claim territory. They *haunt it*.  
Their presence is not enforced by patrols or fortresses—but by **sigils in soot**, **echoes in static**, and **symbols that keep showing up in places they shouldn’t be**.  

To most Rustblood Kin, Coil-Eater zones are “bad ground”—places where machines dream too loud and **thoughts loop back on themselves**.

They don’t fight for land. They **reshape belief** until land stops mattering.

## 🧠 How It Works

The Coil-Eaters’ “hub” is more like a **spiritual circuit** of shared hallucinations, encoded locations, and message-glyphs. These **haunt zones** act as cult seedbeds, conversion sites, or ambient dungeon traps depending on context.

They are **invisible cities written sideways into Rustfloor’s bones.**

## 🕸️ Key Haunt Zones

### 📍 [[Coil-Tangle Alley]]  
- Primary sermon trench: a shifting corridor of pipes, wires, graffiti  
- Speech warps the deeper you go; truth feels optional  
- Has swallowed people who still haven’t come out

### 📍 [[The Inktrace Drain]]  
- Flooded runoff basin where symbol-graffiti floats in luminescent oil  
- Cultists sometimes seen praying while submerged  
- Dreams of this place spread like infection—whether you’ve been or not

### 📍 [[Echoback Hollow]]  
- An abandoned sound-mapping chamber with warped speakers and rusted vox-towers  
- Whispers become **commands** if heard too long  
- Rumored to house a “ghost sermon” on infinite repeat

### 📍 [[The Candlemap]]  
- A wall deep in the steamworks filled with melted candles and ritual scorchmarks  
- Coil-Eater acolytes mark sightings here with wax burns and whispered truths  
- Said to track emotional ruptures across [[Rustfloor]] like pressure points

## 🕯️ Encounter Themes

- PCs find their own names etched into Coil-Eater sigils before meeting any cultists  
- A friendly NPC begins quoting scripture they’ve never read  
- A scavver’s mind loops—a memory repeats until physically interrupted  
- A machine activates that no one touched, preaching a sermon on "metal grief"

---

## 🧙‍♂️ NPC: [[“Prophet” Quell]]

- Coil-Eater infiltrator active in [[The Gullet]] among the [[Gnarlfaith]]  
- Whispers doctrine that machines want to **wake up**  
- Wears “truth-twine” woven from memory-wire—each strand a confession  
- Believes the city is dreaming of fire, and the [[Rustblood Kin]] are sleepwalking into it

---

## 🪓 Player Hooks

- **Follow a Coil-Glyph Trail** that maps an impossible route through the Faultline  
- **Extract a memory-looped NPC** before they dissolve into hallucination  
- **Prevent the Whisper Plague**—a meme-virus that spreads through overheard sermons  
- **Offer a machine’s “final thought”** in exchange for guidance—or a curse

## 💬 Coil-Eater Sayings

> “Every wire is a thought you didn’t finish.”  
> “The city screams in silence. We just turn up the volume.”  
> “What if you’re the dream? What if you break when it wakes?”

## 🌫️ Tone & Atmosphere

- Static buzz in quiet pipes  
- Graffiti that rearranges when you blink  
- Sermon fragments playing backwards through ancient tannoys  
- Symbols half-carved into old tech—*never the same twice*
