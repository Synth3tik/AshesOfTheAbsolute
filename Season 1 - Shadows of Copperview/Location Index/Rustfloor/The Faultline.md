## 🧷 Overview

The Faultline is a **scar** carved into Copperview’s lowest tier—a seismic rupture stabilized with **welded bones, rust altars, and superstition**. It splits deep into the old foundations of the city, where forgotten tech, sealed memory-caches, and **dead truths** are said to dwell.

Most Rustfloor inhabitants fear it.  
The Kin worship it.  
The [[Coil-Eaters]] whisper that it will *split again when the pattern breaks.*

## 🌐 Geography & Structure

The Faultline isn’t static. It creaks, shifts, and moans like it’s **thinking**. Inside:

### 🪨 The Welded Wall  
- Surface barricade of fused scrap and sacred bones  
- Guarded by Kin who demand "proof of rust" to pass  
- Often used for “weight trials”—challenges where entrants must prove their value by carrying relics into the dark and returning with screams

### ⚙️ The Core Split  
- Deep crevasse laced with rebar veins, old support columns, and hanging power lines  
- Gravity feels inconsistent. Heat fluctuates. Sometimes, things fall upward.  
- Home to relics the Kin claim are “screaming to be reborn”

### 🧠 The Old Core Interface  
- A pre-collapse control chamber locked in a looped boot sequence  
- The air smells like memory rot  
- Contains a rusted-out AI system that repeats fractured messages, sometimes in the PCs' own voices

## 🏴 Faction Presence

### [[Ironmaw Kin]]  
- Claim the Faultline as the city's **greatest scar**—a sacred wound left by forgotten rage  
- Treat it as a ritual forgeground: enter with pain, leave with memory  
- Host “clang pilgrimages” where Ironmaw warriors descend into the crevasse to wrestle ghosts or carve their names into seismic stone  
- See the rift not as something to heal—but to **honor** and **keep open**, so the city never forgets it was broken  
- Paint their faces in soot and wear chainmail braced with cracked rebar when guarding the Welded Wall  
- Some veterans claim to have “heard the city scream” from the bottom—and they still echo it in battle


### [[Coil-Eaters]]  
- Leave symbols along rebar veins  
- One cell believes the Faultline was the site of a “failed awakening”  
- Preach that the split is spreading—and one day will *loop upward*

### [[Lockjaw Syndicate]] (Rumored)  
- Supposedly sealed a vault somewhere beneath  
- Some say it holds a recursive kill-code for the entire upper infrastructure  
- Others say it’s already open—and no one came out

## 🎲 Player Hooks

- **Prove your rustweight** to enter—a test of physical, emotional, or ideological burden  
- **Retrieve a Coil-Eater sigil-core** sunk deep in the rebar; it pulses when you lie  
- **Awaken the Faultline’s AI**, which may identify you as someone long dead  
- **Seal the Faultline**... or open it wider, depending on what you believe it *is*

---

## 🧠 Mechanical Themes

- Madness mechanics (Insight rolls to avoid recursive hallucinations)  
- Relic instability (Items change properties when carried too deep)  
- Time slippage (events replay or loop slightly differently—like déjà vu in combat)

## 💬 Local Sayings

> “The city split here. Everything else just followed.”  
> “If it creaks, pray. If it goes silent, *run.*”  
> “The Faultline doesn’t open. It remembers how to.”

## 🌫️ Tone & Atmosphere

- The groaning of old supports echoing like whale-song  
- Torchlight swallowed by thick dust clouds  
- The feeling you’ve *already been here before*—and failed  
- Glyphs vibrating when read aloud  
- Sealed doors whispering in languages no one admits to speaking
