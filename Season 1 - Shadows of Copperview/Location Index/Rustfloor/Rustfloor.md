![[Rustfloor.png]]
## Region  
[[Copperview]]’s lowest inhabited tier — beneath [[The Crucible]], and far beneath concern.

## Description  
Rustfloor is the city’s foundation and its warning label—**a choking sprawl of sacred machinery, broken power lines, and clan-carved metal**. Everything here is failing, yet everything lives. Oil leaks like blood. Lights flicker with memory. The walls remember your footsteps if you listen long enough.

Above, [[The Crucible]] hammers out freight and policy.  
Below, the Kin chant to the bones of machines and call it inheritance.

## Inhabitants  
- Goblin war-clans bound by rustblood ancestry  
- [[Coil-Eaters]] preaching half-truth conspiracies  
- Scrappers and scavvers rebuilding tech like religion  
- Black-market medics and illegal modders selling upgrades with personality glitches  
- Outcasts, failed revolutionaries, and thinkers who lost everything but their rage

## Factions Present  
- [[Rustblood Kin]] – dominant territorial force, fractured but rooted  
- [[Coil-Eaters]] – fragmented but growing; their messages are appearing more often  
- [[Lockjaw Syndicate]] – patrols and reclaim crews, often ambushed or rerouted  
- [[Iron Loop]] – controls the rusted sub-rail and maintenance track system  
- [[Fracture Union]] – hiding in ductwork and steam corridors, trying to matter again

## Themes  
- Ancestry in steel  
- Belief shaped by ruins  
- Industrial mysticism  
- Desperation as dogma  
- Resistance forged, not organized

## 🗺️ Key Locations – Rustfloor

### [[The Gullet]]  
A crumbling incinerator shrine turned sacred furnace-temple for the [[Gnarlfaith]]. They feed offerings—machine, memory, and blood—into its hollow throat and listen for screams of approval.

- Home of the [[Gnarlfaith]]: pain-worshipping fire mystics  
- Sacrificial rites and memory burns occur deep in [[The Maw]]  
- Entry may require a machine sacrifice or ritual branding  
- Coil-Eater influence rumored to be blooming inside

---

### [[The Splitforge]]  
A shattered dome of scrap and steel—sacred dueling pit and warcamp for the [[Ironmaw Kin]]. Here, clang-ring battles echo memory upward into the city’s bones.

- Hub of Ironmaw combat trials and brute diplomacy  
- Place of worship through violence, scars, and steel  
- Outsiders may earn respect (or death) in ritual duels  
- Rumored to host [[Breaker’s Rise]], a public blood rite

---

### [[The Socket Womb]]  
A maze of relic nests, cling-wire tunnels, and sacred junk altars. The [[Grimebound]] live here, guarding their machine-ancestors with superstition and sharp teeth.

- Home of the [[Grimebound]]: hoarders, whisperers, and relic-priests  
- No part may be touched without ritual “slap tests”  
- Tensions brewing around a young heretic secretly fixing things  
- Candlelit tunnels sing back when you speak too loud

---

### [[Coil-Tangle Alley]]  
A deepening trench of intersecting pipes and graffiti where [[Coil-Eaters]] map hallucinations into prophecy. The further in you go, the less real your thoughts feel.

- Moving sermon zone for fragmented truths and corrupted memory  
- Factions avoid it, but some whisper of hidden routes inside  
- Impossible to map. Sometimes, impossible to leave.  
- Repeated visitation may alter memory, voice, or fate

---

### [[The Faultline]]  
A seismic scar carved deep into Rustfloor’s crust. Now holy ground to the [[Ironmaw Kin]], who see it as a sacred wound the city must never forget.

- Claimed by Ironmaw as a memory-forge for ancestral violence  
- Site of weight trials, seismic duels, and ghost-blood pilgrimages  
- Coil-Eaters leave symbols along rebar veins, watched but never removed  
- Contains a collapsed AI chamber repeating corrupted truths in broken loops

---

## 🛠️ Minor Locations – Rustfloor

### [[Shattercap Stacks]]  
Collapsed ventilation columns repurposed into vertical homes and smog dens. Goblins live in hanging scrap-huts stitched together with fanbelt leather and hotwired lighting.

- Home to minor kin families and whisper-smugglers  
- Lightning rods here often pick up voices that aren’t being broadcast  
- Contains a ladder down to a sealed maintenance tunnel no one remembers digging

---

### [[The Knucklebend]]  
A rusted joint tunnel between two long-dead freight routes. Goblins dare each other to race through it with the lights off—because something inside **clicks back**.

- Popular with restless Ironmaw youth  
- Rumored to shift slightly between entries  
- The Coil-Eaters mark it often, then cross their own symbols out

---

### [[The Rattlechant Spire]]  
An old rail signal tower that’s still barely functioning. Wind catches loose metal plates just right, creating harmonic howls that the [[Gnarlfaith]] claim are messages from the Gullet.

- Used as a lookout and prayer post  
- Faint lights blink out morse in no known language  
- Sought after by Coil-Eaters who think it can be tuned

---

### [[The Filthrun]]  
A reeking overflow sluice used to move waste and coolant sludge through collapsed pipe routes. Now used as a shortcut by scavvers and outcasts.

- Slippery, toxic, and always watched  
- Some Grimebound swear certain piles move between visits  
- A kid once fell in and came back three days later, changed

---

### [[Whinepipe Hollow]]  
A natural reverb chamber carved by hydraulic damage and erosion. Sound mutates here—voices echo back wrong, or in different moods.

- Used by Coil-Eaters for “sermon calibration”  
- Local goblins believe it can reveal true intentions… or steal them  
- Sometimes sings without anyone inside

---

### [[The Cradle Cart]]  
An abandoned freight tram locked mid-way between two collapsed stations, now turned into a communal nap-den for wandering goblin youth.

- Lined with furs, old engine grease, and safety signage turned into lullabies  
- Sometimes rocks on its own, even without power  
- A Grimebound child claims it dreams, and gives it gifts to “keep the dreams safe”

---

### [[Dripjack’s Pile]]  
A spiraling junkheap claimed by a goblin recluse who lives inside an ancient mech cockpit and sells “modified prophecies.”

- Pays in fortunes etched onto crushed capacitors  
- Claims the Coil-Eaters stole his dreams  
- Sometimes gives real information—*sometimes*

---

### [[Bellowgut Rail]]  
A crunched and abandoned Loop rail car used as a cookstation and rumor post. Once per cycle, it lets out a whistle even though it’s not connected to power.

- Meeting place for outlaw Kin and Ashvial smugglers  
- Known for its spiced ashbread and “engine broth”  
- Said to be haunted by a Loop worker who refuses to shut up
