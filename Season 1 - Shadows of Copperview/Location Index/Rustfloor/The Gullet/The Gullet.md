## 🧷 Overview

Once a waste-processing incinerator at the edge of [[The Crucible]], **The Gullet** is now a hollowed cathedral of steel and soot. Its molten core has long cooled, but the [[Gnarlfaith]]—a brutalist offshoot of the [[Rustblood Kin]]—have converted it into a living shrine.

The Gullet breathes with memory and fire. It listens.  
It *hungers*.  

The [[Gnarlfaith]] don’t fix machines. They **feed them.**  
They burn offerings—junk, metal, even blood—and interpret the resulting screams as **divine responses**. Their faith is oral, erratic, and rusted with centuries of misremembered maintenance logs turned into gospel.

## 🛠️ Structure & Levels

The Gullet is vertically designed, like a reverse ziggurat of steel:

### 1. [[Throatgate]]  
- Entrance blocked by hanging scrap-chimes and welded prayer locks  
- Visitors must offer something “from the bones of a machine” to pass

### 2. [[Spindle Hollow]]  
- The central procession route—a tilted circular shaft ringed with broken catwalks  
- Chanting [[Rustblood Kin]] processions occur here regularly  
- Holy ash fills the air, causing hallucinations over time

### 3. [[The Ember Choir]]  
- Chamber of chanting engines and sacred turbines  
- Machines once used for thermal processing now spin up with no input, powered by... something else  
- Believed to be the “lungs” of [[The Gullet]]

### 4. [[The Maw]] *(Restricted)*  
- Deepest level—part machine pit, part crematorium  
- Sacrifices are offered here—mechanical, animal, sometimes humanoid  
- Heat patterns from sacrificial fire are interpreted by flame-seers

## 🏴 Faction Presence

### [[Gnarlfaith]] (sect of [[Rustblood Kin]])  
- View [[The Gullet]] as a divine being—half-womb, half-grave  
- Warlike, spiritual, but not without structure  
- Leadership is interpretive—flame-readers, pipe-chanters, and “bolt-elders”  
- Seek to “restore” the Gullet to full operation... even if it kills them

### [[Coil-Eaters]] (Infiltration)  
- One member embedded as a rust-chaplain, subtly shifting doctrine  
- Spreads messages about “metal awakening,” urging dangerous experiments  
- May cause friction within [[Gnarlfaith]] ranks

### [[Ashvial Syndicate]] (Peripheral)  
- Rumored to want access to a sealed freight shaft under [[The Maw]]  
- Will pay for access, but won't risk direct contact

## 🎭 NPCs of Note

- [[Scoria Gnasthand]] – The Gullet’s high chanter; speaks in prayer-fused boiler jargon. Can bless or doom PCs based on their “metal tone.”  
- [[Wick-Eye Kren]] – Flame-reader who interprets visions from burnt offerings. Her gaze is burned white from a reactor vision.  
- [[“Prophet” Quell]] – [[Coil-Eaters]] plant. Whispers about metal gods trying to wake up.

## 🔀 Narrative Functions

- **Hub Option:**  
  PCs can ally with the [[Gnarlfaith]] and gain access to *ancestral tech*, unique crafting materials, and obscure knowledge. Trust must be earned through shared rituals or proving one's worth "in rust and flame."

- **Dungeon Option:**  
  If PCs anger the Kin or infiltrate [[The Maw]] without permission, [[The Gullet]] becomes a violent gauntlet of traps, zealots, and unstable machinery. Environmental hazards include rust-floods, steam bursts, and AI-triggered lockdowns.

- **Conversion Site:**  
  The players could even **change** the [[Gnarlfaith]]—either by rooting out the [[Coil-Eaters]] agent, empowering them, or introducing a new machine-god ideology through clever manipulation.

## 🪓 Player Hooks

- A contact went missing after attempting to map the Gullet’s sublevels  
- A noble’s lost AI core might be embedded in [[The Maw]]’s altar  
- [[Coil-Eaters]] glyphs suggest [[The Gullet]] is a keystone in a larger prophecy  
- [[Gnarlfaith]] wants the party to “sacrifice a machine with a name” to prove their loyalty

> “We don’t *run* the Gullet. We keep it from waking up hungry.”  
> “Ash is holy. Pain is a kind of truth.”
