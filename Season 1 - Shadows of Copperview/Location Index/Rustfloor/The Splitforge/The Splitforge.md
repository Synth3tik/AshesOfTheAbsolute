## 🧷 Overview

[[The Splitforge]] is the heart of the [[Ironmaw Kin]]—a cracked industrial dome, half-collapsed into a rustpit, where sacred clang-rings are held and remembered through **combat, blood, and steel**.  
Furnace towers leak heat into the open air, the ground is scored with old magnetic rails, and every clang of metal is considered a kind of scripture.

This is not a formal coliseum. It’s a **holy wound** in the city's bones.
