## 🧷 Overview

Once a subterranean parts depot connected to the old freight systems of [[The Crucible]], **The Socket Womb** is now a sacred junk-crypt where the [[Grimebound]] store, bless, and protect their most “important” machine-ancestors.  

It’s a **sprawling maze of tangled tunnels, memory piles, twine lines**, and off-limits relic zones marked with oil glyphs and the occasional sharpened gear embedded in a skull.

No map exists. No corridor is safe.  
And *nothing* is to be touched without slapping it first.

## 🧰 Zones & Features

### 🪤 Tangle Path  
- The only semi-reliable way in or out  
- Strung with cling-lines of wire and cloth meant to “channel ancestral current”  
- Touching the wrong string may trigger a wall collapse, a goblin ambush, or a sudden wedding proposal

### ⚙️ The Hiss-Chamber  
- A central vault where relics too dangerous to name are stored in humming crates  
- Grimebound whisper prayers into the ventilation system here and “listen back” for signs  
- Sometimes screams. That’s a good thing, apparently.

### 🪑 The Seat of Old Wind  
- A broken industrial fan housing converted into a shrine-throne  
- No one is allowed to sit on it except [[Brassmother Vesk]]  
- Believed to “keep the Womb from blowing out its memory”

### 🔩 The Bolt Archive  
- A wall of labeled bolts, washers, springs, and servo fragments—each with a name and mini-story  
- Tended by the scribes and younglings who aren’t strong enough for outer scrap gathering  
- May contain parts that belong to upper-tier machines now awakening...

## 🏴 Faction Presence

### [[Grimebound]]  
- Territorial as hell—any outsider must pass a series of "blessing checks" just to avoid being stabbed  
- Proudly ignorant of what any of their machines do, but incredibly protective of them  
- They live in nests strung from scaffolds, duct-tunnels, and wire hammocks  
- At least three holy fights occur per day

## 🎭 Key NPCs

### [[Brassmother Vesk]]  
- Ruler, guardian, and greased matron of the Socket Womb  
- Known to hiss at people who speak too loudly around sacred junk  
- Claims the Womb once “told her a dream” that involved fire, rain, and a goat made of screws

### [[Tinct-Keel]]  
- Young Grimebound secretly learning how things work  
- May invite the party into a secret hideaway if they swear not to tell [[Brassmother Vesk]]  
- Has repaired one machine. It now won’t stop following him.

## 🎲 Player Hooks

- **Retrieve a sacred part** from outside the Womb—but it’s now installed in something important  
- **Negotiate safe passage** through Grimebound territory (requires performing a blessing ritual with duct tape)  
- **Protect or exploit** Tinct-Keel's secret repair—he may have reawakened something buried  
- **Offer a machine sacrifice** in exchange for Grimebound aid in another part of [[Rustfloor]]

## 🌫️ Tone & Vibe

- Oil-slicked tunnels lined with talisman bundles, fused lights, and smudged metal shrines  
- Every object is sacred; every relic has a name and a wrong way to look at it  
- Everything clinks, hums, rattles, or watches you back  
- Goblin cursing in the distance, followed by a crash and reverent silence
