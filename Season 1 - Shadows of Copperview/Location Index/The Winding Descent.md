## Region  
Exterior threshold spiraling down the cliffside toward [[The Crucible]]—Copperview’s unofficial welcome mat and filter.

## Description  
The Winding Descent is the city’s **scarified spiral throat**—a crumbling, stacked switchback path originally carved to haul ore to the surface. It now serves as the only overland entry into Copperview. The path is lined with collapsing scaffolds, faction checkpoints, broken signage, and a permanent backlog of caravans, smugglers, and desperate newcomers.  

It’s not just a road—it’s a gauntlet.  
Before you ever reach the city, it’s already shaping who you’ll be.

## Inhabitants  
- Migrant laborers and tech-runners  
- Smugglers with pre-purchased regrets  
- Grifters, lookouts, and scav-engineers  
- Faction scouts and freelance “queue managers”

## Factions Present  
- [[Iron Loop]] – controls [[Checkpoint Ironjaw]], the primary gate at the base  
- [[Rustblood Kin]] – extorts access and passage from the upper ridges  
- [[Ashvial Syndicate]] – sell counterfeit cargo slips and entry documentation  
- [[Lockjaw Syndicate]] – looms in the distance, never visible—but everyone assumes they’re watching  
- [[Free Operators]] – unaffiliated smugglers who promise shortcuts… most of which involve consequences

## Themes  
- Entry as ordeal  
- Bureaucracy as violence  
- The journey down as transformation  
- Survival is a decision—and a tax

## Key Locations

### [[Checkpoint Ironjaw]]  
The official border between The Winding Descent and [[The Crucible]]—a fortified checkpoint assembled from rusted rail, civic signage, and old Loop armor. It's not just about who can enter—it's about **who can afford to wait**.

- Bribery, barter, or bluff required for passage  
- Faction representatives watch every move  
- Can be a full session’s worth of conflict on its own

---

### [[The Gutterstep Quarter]]  
A set of crumbling rest stations, food stalls, mod-huts, and faith shrines stacked into the cliffside. This is where people stall out—and where deals get made while no one’s watching.

- Home to traveling medics, fixers, and personality thieves  
- [[Coil-Eaters]] symbols have started showing up in rust and wax  
- PCs might find safe haven or lose everything in an hour

---

### [[Splitjaw Ravine]]  
A broken branch of the Descent collapsed decades ago—now used for smuggling, blackmail meetups, and alleged [[Coil-Eaters]] “sermon ambushes.”

- Used as a secret entry point if [[Checkpoint Ironjaw]] is blocked  
- Possibly connects to hidden [[Rustfloor]] passages  
- Risk of collapse or ritual encounter high

## Player Hooks

- Get trapped in the backlog and forced into a side conflict, riot, or sabotage  
- Learn someone in the caravan line is already marked for assassination  
- Be offered a job from each faction—none of which can be taken without offending the others
