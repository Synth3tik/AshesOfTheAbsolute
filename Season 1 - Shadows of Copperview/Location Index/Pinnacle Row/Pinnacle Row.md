## Region  
Top public tier of Copperview — glittering towers, reputation fortresses, and party halls where politics drinks itself pretty.

## Description  
Pinnacle Row is **where wealth becomes narrative**. The powerful don’t argue here—they sponsor. It’s a tier built not just on gold, but on **visibility, manipulation, and image discipline**. No one says what they mean. Everyone means what they look like. From spa-states to soft-law tribunals, this is where cultural dominance is bought, and revolutions are aesthetic trends.  

**Every party here is a press release.**  
**Every glance could end a life.**

## Key Locations

### [[The Mirrordome]]  
Glazeline’s central influence hive. A crystal-structured palace of lights, stages, and livestreaming altars. To be seen here is to be *made.*

- Entry requires clout or escort  
- Players may be invited as a test—or a trap  
- Narrative arcs can be rewritten in real-time

---

### [[The Dream Suite]]  
Coiled Bloom’s flagship clinic: part neural rewiring spa, part memory therapy hive. Emotions are sculpted here like art.

- Clients may emerge new people  
- Loyalty, love, and grief are programmable  
- Important NPCs may be compromised unknowingly

---

### [[The White Ribbon Vaults]]  
Crownspire’s most exclusive private leisure wings—skybound baths, memory-proof lounges, and “business rooms” with sensory dampening.

- Rumors suggest bribes and blackmail are traded here over massages  
- Enemies become friends—or something worse—overnight  
- Players may be invited to prove influence or loyalty

---

### [[The Glass Tribunal]]  
Glitzgarde’s public stage for “aesthetic judgment.” More fashion show than courtroom, but with real consequences.  

- Used to exile dissenters, banish rivals, or crown new icons  
- The guilty are often the unfashionable  
- Audience reactions are tracked and influence final outcomes
