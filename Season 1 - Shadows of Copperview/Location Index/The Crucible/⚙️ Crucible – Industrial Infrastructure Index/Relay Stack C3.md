## Type  
Power regulation tower cluster / civic current spine

## Region  
[[The Crucible]]

## 📷 Description  
**Relay Stack C3**, nicknamed *“The Spine”*, is a spiked forest of insulated towers and arc-distribution pylons. Power pulses climb like lightning up braided conduits into the mid-tier lift systems and across the Crucible’s core infrastructure.

It doesn’t just hum. It **breathes in volts**.

This is where current becomes policy—where energy loads are rerouted for factions, blackouts are negotiated, and one wrong overload turns a block into vapor.

> “The Spine never sleeps. It just resets your memory.”

## ⚡ Structure & Features

- **Pulse Towers** – Insulated spikes housing the stack’s vertical circuits, glowing with ripple light  
- **Conduit Loops** – Primary current lines draped like steel arteries across gantries and struts  
- **Anchor Nodes** – Stabilization cells with resonance-tuned regulators; locked behind timed sequence hatches  
- **Control Deck 2B** – Official Iron Loop routing desk, retrofitted with a whisper-shield wall. Also: half-flooded.  
- **Failsafe Chamber** – No one has seen it. Rumored to be beneath the baseplate. Light bends oddly near it.

## 🔥 Conditions & Hazards

- **Ambient Current:** Sparks jump on proximity if improperly grounded  
- **EM Surge Points:** Can scramble electronics, memories, or lesser enchantments  
- **Auditory Static:** Random bursts of *incorrect voice playback* from relay terminals  
- **Gravity Drift:** Areas near Conduit Loop 3 briefly reverse weight pressure during high-demand cycles

## 🧷 Faction Presence

- **[[Iron Loop]]** – Operates the relay; maintains baseline control and surge protocols. Oversees the routing queues.  
- **[[Lockjaw Syndicate]]** – Watches, but doesn’t touch. Yet. Multiple engineers have been “transferred” after seeing too much.  
- **[[Coil-Eaters]]** – Believed to be decoding Stack echo patterns as prophecy. Glyphs appear behind access panels.  
- **[[Ashvial Syndicate]]** – Pays to tap residual power and siphon recharge banks for unknown storage rigs.

## 🎲 Player Hooks

- **Echo Loop:** A surge causes a nearby control node to repeat a player’s voice—saying something they never said.  
- **Rigged Blackout:** A false overload warning triggers an automatic redirect. It was forged. Someone’s using the Stack to cut power to a district for *something else*.  
- **Ghost Frequency:** An engineer asks the PCs to listen to a harmonic buried in the relay. It contains numbers. Those numbers are **coordinates**—to somewhere that no longer exists.  
- **Feedback Pact:** A dormant control rod activates on contact. Whoever touched it gets a vision… or a contract. Or both.  
- **Failsafe Whisper:** A child from Burnstack hears humming that matches the Stack’s tone. She repeats the hum. Doors start unlocking.

## 💥 Gameplay Opportunities

- **Skill Challenges:** Grounding gear puzzles, timing surges to move between paths, resonance decoding  
- **Combat Environments:** Shifting electrical fields, timed hazard waves, static fields that scramble actions  
- **Investigation:** Hidden rerouting trails, forged command logs, sabotaged voltage masks  
- **Mystery Threads:** Traces of **ancient civic architecture** buried below—older than Loop, older than power

## 🔐 Secrets & Threads

- The control systems include a **language no one claims to have written**  
- A secondary tower pulses in **four-beat intervals**, mimicking the rhythm of the city’s surface elevator systems… which aren’t connected  
- An encrypted message was hidden inside the Stack’s pulse rhythm—decoded as: “Don’t forget to wake it”  
- One tower has **never** powered down. Records say it doesn’t exist.

## 💬 Local Sayings

> “The Spine hears everything. It just filters slow.”  
> “When the lights flicker, duck. It’s not always voltage.”  
> “It’s not the current that kills you. It’s what remembers afterward.”
