Primary metalworks line / crucible-core forge artery

## Region  
[[The Crucible]]

---

## 📷 Description  
**Smeltline 47** is the furnace belt of the Crucible. A kilometer-long corridor of conveyor beds, alloy crucibles, magnetic clamps, and automated pour rigs. It runs molten steel, civic salvage, and mineral haul from the Rustfloor into processed output for freight, rails, and civic plating.

This is the kind of place where the heat warps memory, where workers forget their last names, and where every fifth door leads to a shaft that shouldn't exist.

> “If you feel the floor pulse, move. It’s about to breathe fire.”

## 🛠️ Functionality & Layout

- **Main Belt Spine:** Dual-track conveyor running raw ore and scrap  
- **Crucible Pits:** Superheated alloy processing tanks suspended by magnetic rigs  
- **Cool-Arc Gantries:** Where processed metal is flash-cooled and stamped  
- **Smog Troughs:** Narrow walkways under the belt, riddled with vent-choke and coolant burst scars  
- **Service Alcoves:** Lined with rusted terminals, lightless doors, and tool racks warped by proximity heat

## ☢️ Environmental Conditions

- Temperature: 60–80°C baseline near crucibles  
- Visibility: Smoke-hazy, visibility drops with every burst weld  
- Hazards: Conveyor traps, vent eruptions, metal sloshbacks, coil-clamps that seize without warning  
- Smell: Burnt metal, ozone, old blood, and coolant musk

## 🧷 Faction Presence

- **[[Iron Loop]]** – Controls the line. Operates in rotating four-hour safety shifts. Most guards are exhausted or half-melted into their gear.  
- **[[Fracture Union]]** – Cells once worked here. Some traps still “tick.” Ghost tags show up on the girders.  
- **[[Rustblood Kin]]** – Whispers speak of something *beneath* the floor. A sealed vent gate near Belt West hums when no one's near.  
- **[[Ashvial Syndicate]]** – Known to smuggle “hard-burned” alloys and rerouted output crates. Often bribe or blackmail shift engineers.

## 🎲 Player Hooks

- **Molten Package:** A shipment meant to be intercepted contains a mysterious forged alloy—still hot. Someone wants it stopped *mid-line*.  
- **Saboteur Standoff:** A Fracture Union glyph activates nearby—signaling a planned line collapse. Who’s still down there?  
- **Breach Gate:** A sealed lift door behind the west crucible starts opening on its own. There’s **no line behind it**.  
- **Heat-Ghost:** Workers speak of a figure that only appears in reflected slag. It watches but doesn’t burn. Until it does.  
- **Melted Schematic:** A scalded Loop worker hands the party a map—half-destroyed—but it shows something buried under Smeltline that "was never smelted right."

## 💥 Gameplay Opportunities

- **Skill Encounters:** Navigating conveyor jumps, vent dodging, rig timing  
- **Combat:** Heat hazard layers, molten terrain, moving cover on belt cars  
- **Exploration:** Vent crawlways leading to forgotten side systems  
- **Social:** Bribing tired Loop guards, confronting Ashvial mules, leveraging a shift union disagreement

## 🎴 Secrets & Threads

- The **core crucible** may be sentient—whispers heard in the metal, responding to blood heat  
- A **Loop engineer** has been quietly swapping raw ore for scrap from Rustfloor—what are they hiding in it?  
- A **Coil-Eater glyph** was seen drawn in slag on the cooling floor… hours *before* it cooled  
- Somewhere under the melt-grates, an **ancient forge-altar** from before Loop control is still warm—and *hungry*
