## 📷 Description  
**Spilltrack 12** is one of Copperview’s oldest and most dangerous utility corridors—a sludge-lined overflow trench that winds like a broken memory through the underside of [[Vatcore Delta]] and beneath parts of [[Smeltline 47]]. It was meant to carry away failed alchemical matter, burnt coolant, and unstable civic waste.

Now? It carries whispers, too.

The pipes hum. The runoff glows. And the locals tell you not to follow anything with your name on it.

> “If you see your reflection in the waste, don’t wave.”

## ☣️ Structure & Terrain

- **Main Flow Channel** – A knee-high river of mutagenic slurry, segmented by choked filter gates and corrosion-thin catwalks  
- **Pressure Bulbs** – Bubble-like growths in the wall infrastructure—pressurized from within, leaking heat or static  
- **Reverse Valves** – One-way fluid locks occasionally pulsing backward, sucking anything light enough into deeper system veins  
- **Service Lanes** – Narrow lateral ducts lined with blistered signage, ritual graffiti, and dripping cable molds  
- **Echo Blisters** – Alcoves where sounds replay out of order or as hallucinated voices

## 🧷 Faction Presence

- **[[Ashvial Syndicate]]** – Dumps failed reagents and forbidden mixes here; known to hide sealed flasks along the current  
- **[[Coil-Eaters]]** – Treat Spilltrack 12 as holy. Dream sermons are recorded here by listening to the gurgle patterns  
- **[[Iron Loop]]** – Disavows responsibility; “track 12 was delisted after 9 minor fatalities and 1 unprovable event”  
- **[[Fracture Union]]** – Uses one of the side ducts as a smuggling path. They don’t go near the main channel.

## 🎲 Player Hooks

- **Whispered Confession:** A Coil-Eater asks the party to recover a “floating truth capsule” that only responds to blood. It’s already downstream.  
- **Lost Transport:** A sealed container meant for disposal washed loose. It's leaking a **chemical that alters memory** when inhaled—and it knows the party’s names.  
- **Echo Message:** A warning plays from a rusted speaker, repeating a phrase only one PC has ever heard—in their childhood.  
- **Bio-Reclaimer Hunt:** A toxic scavenger crew offers coin for help dragging a body out of the sludge. It’s... still warm.  
- **Glyph Emergence:** Coil symbols appear mid-flow, burning into the liquid itself—*before* they’re drawn. Someone upstream is dreaming the future into the waste.

## 💥 Gameplay Opportunities

- **Hazard Navigation:** Toxic environment, slow erosion over time, pressure bursts, flow puzzles  
- **Combat Arena:** Narrow walkways, shifting flow levels, enemies immune to mutagenic side effects  
- **Mystery & Horror:** Looping audio fragments, hallucinations of other players, tracking something that shouldn't know your route  
- **Exploration:** Unlocking a submerged vault grate with a pressure key. Contains… not water

## 🧬 Secrets & Threads

- A **floodgate beneath the track** opens only when three specific vocal harmonics are played—one known only to Coil-Eaters  
- Ashvial once lost a **bioconductive archive coil** here. It’s believed to contain the original formula for a banned truth-altering alchemical  
- A **sermon loop** embedded in the walls keeps updating daily. No one has touched the system in decades  
- Somewhere near the tail of the flow, there’s a door. It's always locked. It's labeled “**Vault Δ–Δ**”. No one can say the symbol aloud.

> “If the flow stops, run. It means something’s drinking.”  
> “Coil-Eaters say it loops. I say it waits.”  
> “Spilltrack 12 remembers more than it forgets. That’s the problem.”
