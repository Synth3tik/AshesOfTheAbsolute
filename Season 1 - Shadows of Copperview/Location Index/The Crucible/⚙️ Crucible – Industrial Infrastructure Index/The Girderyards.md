## 📷 Description  
**The Girderyards** are where Copperview’s bones are forged—**civic scaffolds, mag-rails, tower bracings, and tier clamps**, all assembled in clattering rhythm by rigged machine banks and soot-stained crews.  

Every sound here is industrial scripture: the whine of auto-welders, the hiss of magnetic shears, the clang of something falling that no one saw. You don’t walk through the Girderyards. You **weave between projects that might not be paused**.

> “Don’t get used to the floor. It’s probably temporary.”

## 🏗️ Layout & Features

- **Assembly Cradles** – Suspended production rigs that lower fabricated girders into temporary shapes for welding  
- **Frame Lines** – Conveyor-fed chassis beds churning out modular civic skeletons  
- **Heat-Gantry Loops** – Overhead mobile weld arms running in 30-second sweeps  
- **Core Vault A** – Secured housing for **experimental support frames**—off-limits except by civic writ (or clever sabotage)  
- **The Drop Canal** – A trench chute where rejected parts and failed prototypes are scrapped—or disappear

## 🔩 Environmental Conditions

- Light: Orange and flickering, filtered through safety lamps and welding flare  
- Noise: Deafening. Speech possible only through vox-slat transmitters or hand signals  
- Terrain: Slick with lubricant, scattered tools, partially-fused girders, and dangerous cross-beams  
- Movement: Some platforms and cranes move *without warning*

## 🧷 Faction Presence

- **[[Iron Loop]]** – Controls overall production; uses forged “Transit Plates” to prioritize certain clients  
- **[[Lockjaw Syndicate]]** – Keeps contractors here on payroll, watching for asset leverage or useful blackmail  
- **[[Fracture Union]]** – Old structural blueprints were burned here during the Collapse. Some cells hide their messages inside support welds  
- **[[Ashvial Syndicate]]** – Reclaimed steel has been going missing. Their seal was found burned into a false girder near Core Vault A

## 🎲 Player Hooks

- **Misassembled Load:** A frame is about to be shipped bearing unstable welds—and the party holds a schematic proving it will collapse under tier-stress  
- **Buried Design:** A prototype civic-support was created here… then hidden. It's in one of the discarded molds. Maybe.  
- **Machine Loyalty:** One of the girder-sculpting units has begun *resisting override*. It refuses to stop welding. It's only building one shape now—and it’s repeating.  
- **Sabotage Blackmail:** Someone forged a project number into a real load, smuggling illicit plating through civic channels. The party finds out. So does someone else.  
- **Fracture Message:** A worker gifts the party a chunk of scrap. Inside the girder’s weld is a hidden blueprint... and a message: *“We still see the spine.”*

## 💥 Gameplay Opportunities

- **Climbing & Navigation:** Mobile cradles, rotating scaffolds, and vertigo-level elevation puzzles  
- **Combat in Motion:** Girders being moved mid-fight, welding sparks acting as cover hazards  
- **Investigation:** Trace structural sabotage, uncover schematics, reveal blacklisted frame models  
- **Social:** Negotiate with weld crews, intimidate contractors, navigate civic codes to get access to Core Vault A

## ⚙️ Secrets & Threads

- Core Vault A’s **experimental frame** is rumored to adapt to vertical pressure like a living thing—it may have been **grown**, not welded  
- A girder model used in *all major city bridges* contains a signature tag… but the designer died three years before it was stamped  
- One of the frame loaders now **builds sigil-shapes** into its support beams when unobserved  
- The Drop Canal doesn’t always return sound. Workers say it echoes *from the wrong direction*

## 💬 Local Sayings

> “If the Yard likes you, it builds slow. Gives you time to run.”  
> “Every structure screams. The good ones don’t let you hear it.”  
> “We don’t make the bones of the city. We remind it it has some.”
