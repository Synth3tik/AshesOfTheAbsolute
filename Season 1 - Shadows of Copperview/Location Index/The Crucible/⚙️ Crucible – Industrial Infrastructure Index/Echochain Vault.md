## Type  
Sealed infrastructure relic / recursive memory crypt / civic anomaly

## Region  
[[The Crucible]] *(beneath or between [[Spilltrack 12]] and unmarked load-bearing tunnels)*

## 📷 Description  
No one builds doors like this anymore.  
**Echochain Vault** sits sealed behind rusted ballast locks and a heat-fused grate with no opening mechanism. It hums—not from power, but from *expectation*.  

The entrance is ringed with **acoustic wards**—symbols that react to spoken word or playback tones. They change position when no one watches. The floor around it is uneven with heat scars and memory-flicker echoes.  
Nothing official marks its existence.

> “It’s not just sealed. It’s meant to be *remembered wrong*.”

## 🔐 Structure & Entry Mechanics

- **Access Lock** – Requires a three-tone harmonic key or specific phrasing only recorded once (possibly within [[Relay Stack C3]] logs)  
- **Entry Threshold** – Causes a memory shift on crossing: party members experience 3–5 seconds of *alternate* pasts  
- **Initial Vault Ring** – A circular corridor looping back unnaturally, where torchlight follows behind instead of leading ahead  
- **Inner Chamber Grid** – A failed containment lattice of rotating archive pylons, now restructured into mnemonic vaults

## 🧷 Faction Interest

- **[[Hollow Deck]]** – Believed to have staked future wagers on what’s locked inside. One agent claimed: “The odds on this vault are reality-weighted.”  
- **[[Coil-Eaters]]** – Consider this a wound in the city's brain. One of their founders allegedly *came from inside*.  
- **[[Lockjaw Syndicate]]** – Refuses to acknowledge it. Rumored to have a clause buried in civic law forbidding “vaulted recursion sites.”  
- **[[Ashvial Syndicate]]** – Rumored to have sealed a prototype truth-binding contract inside: a phrase that rewrites history when spoken aloud.

## 🎲 Player Hooks

- **Anomaly Ping:** A backdoor AI from [[Relay Stack C3]] references “Echochain Delta prime” in its last loop. No one remembers coding that.  
- **Found Token:** A Coil-Eater glyph-stone whispers in a player’s sleep. It vibrates when they pass the locked entrance.  
- **Contracted Bet:** A Hollow Deck agent offers the party a wager: open the Vault, and he’ll show them what they lost *last time*.  
- **Memory Reroute:** Someone the party knows references an event they never experienced. The date links to Echochain.  
- **Dream Wound:** One PC dreams of waking *in* the Vault. They have marks on their arm that don’t match current timelines.

## 🧠 Themes & Gameplay

- **Time Disruption:** Rooms that reset. Conversations that repeat incorrectly. Gear altered subtly after each room  
- **Puzzle-Locked Progression:** Players must recreate tones, phrases, or emotional states to proceed  
- **Philosophical Horror:** Realization that the Vault was not meant to *contain*—it was meant to be forgotten  
- **Looped Identity:** Players may temporarily inherit the thoughts or motives of former “echoes” who entered before

## 🧬 Secrets & Threads

- A central **mnemonic archive stone** remembers a version of Copperview *that burned to ash centuries ago*—but that never happened  
- A name, carved into a wall, matches a PC’s—but is two generations too old  
- One vault shelf contains **sealed emotion-states**, extracted and recorded like spells. Touching one imprints it *for 1d4 hours*  
- The innermost chamber contains **no light source**—but you see clearly anyway. What you see, however, depends on who remembers you

## 💬 Local Sayings (Whispered)

> “Some vaults keep things safe. This one keeps them *real*.”  
> “If you dream in threes, stay away from the locks.”  
> “The Chain doesn’t echo. It *reminds*.”

## Dungeon Flag  
✅ Ideal for a **Tier 2+ delve**  
✅ Can house a campaign arc revelation
