## 📷 Description  
**Vatcore Delta** is the Crucible’s largest alchemical refinement sector—an insulated jungle of containment tanks, gurgling conduits, pressure regulators, and fog-crawling gantries. It processes industrial reagents, coolant mixtures, dreamcatalysts, and a dozen chemicals that don’t officially exist.

Part of it is still civic-run. Part of it is rented by the [[Ashvial Syndicate]]. All of it is poisonous.

## 🛠️ Functionality & Layout

- **Mix Columns** – Multi-story glass-tube vats stacked in rotating chemical banks  
- **Fog Ladders** – Scaffold towers rising through reaction mist, slippery and rust-patched  
- **Sample Troughs** – Open sluice canals where refined outputs trickle toward coolant systems  
- **Discharge Bay 5** – A sealed runoff core where discolored gas bleeds from under grated doors  
- **Transit Line γ-13** – Cargo rail line that loops around the upper vats; repurposed for Ashvial-only shipments

## ☣️ Environmental Conditions

- Visibility: <10 ft in center zones due to vapor saturation  
- Sound: Low bubbling, high-pitched vent hissing, occasional “chemical screams” (normal?)  
- Light: Pale green and rust-orange, filtered through safety glows and reaction pulses  
- Touch Hazards: Anything wet is potentially caustic; gloves won’t save you

## 🧷 Faction Presence

- **[[Ashvial Syndicate]]** – Runs several “leased” refinery modules. Nobody’s sure where their territory ends.  
- **[[Iron Loop]]** – Maintains rail access and coolant distribution—but doesn’t like being inside too long.  
- **[[Fracture Union]]** – Uses the vapors to hide movement and sabotage pressure vents. Glyphs appear in steam condensation.  
- **[[Coil-Eaters]]** – Whispers claim that dreams shared in the fog sometimes match Coil sermons… verbatim.

## 🎲 Player Hooks

- **Experimental Spill:** An unstable alchemical compound is leaking through Transit γ-13. Ashvial denies it. But the fog is whispering things it shouldn't.  
- **Tagged Crate:** The party finds a crate marked for destruction—but the label was forged. What's inside is alive, or *used to be*.  
- **Fogwalker:** Locals speak of a figure walking through the thickest sections—never burns, never breathes, leaves trails of clear air behind  
- **Stolen Formula:** An old Ashvial reagent key was stolen and hidden here. It’s coded into a fog pattern only visible when you *inhale the right mix*.  
- **Dream Echo:** A PC has a vision during exposure. It shows a different Copperview—one cleaner. One impossible. One marked “Delta Prime.”

## 💥 Gameplay Opportunities

- **Exploration Challenge:** Navigating fog density, shifting floor grids, broken lifts  
- **Puzzle Hook:** Tracking reagent outputs to reverse-engineer a sabotaged batch  
- **Combat Complication:** Area denial via caustic clouds, steam-pressurized burst traps  
- **Social Play:** Bribing Ashvial chem-guards, exposing a Loop engineer blackmail ring, bargaining with a reactionist cook for “safe passage”

## 🧪 Secrets & Threads

- One of the **reactor vats isn’t registered**—but it refills every day  
- **Ashvial** is rumored to be testing **emotion-triggered chem-bonds** here—mixtures that only activate if you *feel the right way*  
- **Transit γ-13** loops through an unlisted section where the fog glows blue. It’s always locked. Except when it’s not.  
- Someone carved a **Coil-Eater glyph** into the central coolant core. It's corroded in, not etched. Acid made it.
