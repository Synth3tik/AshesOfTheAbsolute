## Region  
[[The Crucible]]

## Description  
Beneath the living decks of [[The Threadline]] and the open heat of [[Burnstack Commons]], the Crucible's **industrial spine** churns. These zones are where Copperview's freight gets melted, its air gets filtered, its chemical wastes get processed, and its mistakes get buried. Each is partially functional, fully dangerous, and saturated with factional fingerprints.

These aren't dungeons‚Äîuntil they become one.

## Suggested Use

These zones can be:
- **Traversal hubs**: The fastest paths are through risk  
- **Faction flashpoints**: Sabotage, theft, or protection of industrial processes  
- **Dungeon spaces**: Dynamic hazards, non-static layout, ambient danger  
- **Narrative engines**: The city's memory and mechanics are leaking here. Something wants out‚Äîor back in.
