## Region  
The industrial threshold of [[Copperview]]—officially sanctioned, barely functioning, and burning at both ends.

## Description  
The Crucible is the first true layer of Copperview, built from reinforced platforms, smog-belching rail towers, and so many overlapping permit zones that every gate feels like a challenge. It sits above [[Rustfloor]] and below [[Mirage Rise]], acting as the city's **main intake system**—for freight, fuel, and people.

Everything passes through the Crucible eventually.  
Not everything makes it back out.

This is where the city’s machinery grinds loudest: steel on steel, voice on voice, deal on deal. Every faction here needs something, owes something, or is waiting to see who cracks first.

## Inhabitants  
- Freight haulers, checkpoint agents, rail workers, and burnt-out civic engineers  
- Black-market forgers, smugglers, saboteurs, and parolee inventors  
- Refugees trying to escape Rustfloor  
- Tourists, scholars, and diplomats with no idea what they’ve walked into

## Factions Present  
- [[Iron Loop]] – controls rail access, freight lifts, and Checkpoint Ironjaw  
- [[Fracture Union]] – fragmented resistance cells buried in scaffolds and ducts  
- [[Ashvial Syndicate]] – runs fake ID networks and chemical smuggling through port hubs  
- [[Lockjaw Syndicate]] – uses “infrastructure audits” and permit enforcement to maintain grip  
- [[Glitzgarde]] – appear suddenly when protests escalate, then leave in better shoes

## Themes  
- Infrastructure as battleground  
- Permits as power  
- Corruption as survival  
- Border tension and transactional brutality  
- Identity is who says you are

## Key Locations

### [[Checkpoint Ironjaw]]  
The Crucible’s primary entry gate into Copperview proper—a fortified checkpoint built from salvage, rusted rail, and bureaucracy. It’s run day-to-day by [[Iron Loop]], but anyone with bribes, muscle, or blackmail has pulled the levers at some point.

- First impression of Copperview for most arrivals  
- Place where bribes, bargains, and denials collide  
- Early encounter zone with multiple faction threads

---

### [[The Threadline]]  
A tangle of suspended catwalks, dangling cable routes, and makeshift lift junctions connecting old rail systems. Part smuggler alley, part collapse waiting to happen.

- Controlled loosely by [[Fracture Union]] remnants  
- Used by [[Ashvial Syndicate]] runners to reroute goods  
- Occasionally “audited” by [[Glitzgarde]] via surprise rope drop

---

### [[Spillgate Terminal]]  
A disused freight yard now overrun by black-market vendors, bootleg mechanics, and unofficial parcel routers. Ashvial has deep roots here, but no one claims it outright.

- Safe ground for illegal upgrades, forged permits, and rumormongering  
- Parties may be offered work—or have work done to them  
- Crates here sometimes talk

---

### [[The Railhusk]]  
The hollowed corpse of an old Loop locomotive, now retrofitted into a bar, rumor depot, and bolt-hole for the desperate. Known for its single working headlight and no exit fee.

- Neutral meeting ground (sort of)  
- Characters from all factions pass through, usually more than once  
- No fighting inside. The Railhusk fights back.

- Learn the real reason [[Glitzgarde]] showed up four days early for a “security drill”

## Local Sayings  
> “If the Crucible doesn’t break you, it just hasn’t finished yet.”  
> “Permits can be bought. Passages have to be earned.”  
> “The Loop keeps it moving. The rest of us try not to get caught under the wheels.”
