## 📷 Description  
**Burnstack Commons** is the Crucible’s sweltering underbelly—a flat, soot-caked expanse where exhaust towers bleed pressure, freight lines screech around corners, and the hum of machinery never really stops.  
It's not a neighborhood. It's a **byproduct with benches**.

Nestled between rows of heat stack regulators and public utility conduits, this zone serves as both **rest stop and reality check** for the thousands who work Copperview's furnaces, loaders, valve systems, and powerlines.

> You come to Burnstack because there’s nowhere left to go—then you make it work.

## 🏗️ Environment & Structure

- Built across a **reinforced slab** of maintenance concrete at the Crucible's lowest stable plateau  
- **Exhaust stacks** tower like chimneys from forgotten gods—shunting thermal and chemical pressure from deeper systems  
- **Patchwork cooling units**, **stabilizer fans**, and **shaded rest areas** line the walkways  
- **Housing clusters** built into old conduit channels and insulated power shells—simple, rugged, and close to the floor

---

## 🛠️ Cultural Identity

Burnstack is a place of **function first**. Work defines life here. Comfort is what you barter for on break.

- The people are **resilient, soot-slicked, and half-joking**, shaped by the rhythm of pressure releases and shift bells  
- Every vent squeal or pipe groan is part of the neighborhood soundtrack  
- Conversations are had over coolant tanks, while adjusting heat masks or swapping shift favors  
- **Loop workers, auxiliary techs, bootleg mechanics**, and even a few burned-out permit clerks call it home

Despite everything, **Burnstack is weirdly communal**. No one’s safe—but no one’s forgotten either.

## 🧱 Key Locations

### 🔧 [[Centerplate Deck]]  
A wide circular slab surrounded by service scaffolds and food vendors. It’s where people eat, wait for jobs, pass out, or get recruited.

- Known for its **pressure vent benches**—warmth in winter, scalding in summer  
- A good place to listen, drink, and pretend nothing’s broken until someone screams  
- [[Iron Loop]] uses it for “shift announcements” and safety lectures. People mostly ignore them.

---

### 🧊 Coolant Shrine  
An old broken radiator column turned communal prayer and offering space.  
People tie rags soaked in sweat to it, whispering names of lost co-workers.

- Flowers sometimes wilt into steam here  
- A preacher from the [[Rustfloor]] comes weekly to offer soot-blessings  
- Some swear the fan still turns—only when it forgives

---

### 🧰 Partslinger's Rest  
A low canopy of tarp and welded pipe tables run by semi-retired tool vendors, permit fixers, and back-alley doctors.

- Offers cheap repairs, rumor-swaps, and unregulated limb realignment  
- One table always has free water… but it tastes like wire memory  
- [[Ashvial Syndicate]] couriers frequent it, but never linger long

---

### 🎲 The Ember Knot  
A semi-legal, [[Hollow Deck]]-run gambling pit carved into the side of a disused fuel storage ring. Lit by re-wired arc lamps and steam glow, it’s equal parts bar, bet-house, and trap.

- Bets range from card slates to performance dares, dice reels, and work-shift wagers  
- “The House” always wins—but not immediately. Newcomers often get lucky *just once*  
- Winnings include credits, parts, forged permits… or silence on something best left unrecorded  
- [[Hollow Deck]] agents monitor the crowd. If you’re interesting, they make sure you come back

> “You don’t lose the first time. You get marked.”

## 🏛️ Faction Presence

- **[[Iron Loop]]** — Omnipresent but informal. This is just where their people sleep, eat, and occasionally complain.  
- **[[Ashvial Syndicate]]** — Present in courier lanes, chem-handoff points, and unofficial treatment corners.  
- **[[Fracture Union]]** — Old graffiti resurfaces often. No one admits to anything.  
- **[[Hollow Deck]]** — Growing influence. They run [[The Ember Knot]], seed debts in games of “harmless fun,” and track the unlucky like investments.  
- **[[Lockjaw Syndicate]]** — Not welcome, but not absent. Their emissaries get “watched” until they leave.

## 🎲 Player Hooks & Encounters

- A Loop worker drops dead mid-break, clutching a permit that names one of the PCs as a supervisor they’ve never met  
- A coolant line ruptures during a conversation, revealing a hidden rust-channel bearing [[Fracture Union]] markings  
- A local boy offers to sell you a map to “the part of the Commons that still remembers names”  
- A gambling ring at [[The Ember Knot]] uses rigged permits as poker chips. One has the wrong name… but the right sigil  
- A rumor spreads that someone won big at the Knot—then vanished mid-toast, leaving behind a chair still warm and a contract written in blinking runes

---

## 🎯 Player Use

- Social anchor point in the Crucible—access to **rumors, black-market services, local labor culture**  
- Transition space between safe navigation and deeper factory danger  
- Great place to set up contact networks, faction reputation shifts, or resource gathering  
- Can turn hostile if **infrastructure is tampered with**, or if the party gains [[Lockjaw Syndicate]] interest
