## Type  
Suspended residential-industrial district, [[Iron Loop]] civic tier, freight transit hub

## Region  
[[The Crucible]]

---

## 📷 Description  
Spanning the entire ceiling of [[The Crucible]]’s industrial pit, the **Threadline** is Copperview’s most critical *suspended district*—an aerial grid of catwalk tenements, freight platforms, cable-strung bunk towers, and pulley-linked households. This is [[Iron Loop]]’s home turf, where union families live atop the infrastructure they maintain.

It is the **lungs and ceiling** of the Crucible—built above the noise, but never far enough to forget it.

> “Below us, the factories scream. Above us, the papers lie. Here? We work. We survive.”

## 🛠️ Purpose & Identity

- The Threadline is the **[[Iron Loop]]’s domestic zone**: mid-air dwellings for freight staff, civic engineers, cable riders, and permit clerks  
- It acts as a **transit web**, controlling access between upper civic nodes, lift-lines, and freight rails  
- Built from **decommissioned lift towers, old train cranes, and rebraced scaffolds**, it's stable—but always humming

It is **habitable**, **industrial**, and **self-sustaining**—but every inch reminds you it's part of a machine that never stops.

## 🧱 Living Infrastructure

- **Liftcoil Lofts** – Worker housing stacked on old winch towers, connected by swinging bridges and powered by backup rail converters  
- **Switchyard Plazas** – Large open-air grid sectors used for community meets, repair shops, and union briefings. Sometimes hijacked for food stalls or illegal freight bets  
- **Rigging Schools** – Every Threadline child learns rope handling, rail balancing, and platform reading. Safety isn’t optional. It’s survival.  
- **Signal Gardens** – Mini broadcast stations running encrypted [[Iron Loop]] comms. Sometimes hijacked by rogue frequencies—[[Fracture Union]] graffiti nearby is common

## 🛒 Notable Zones

### ➤ Cradlebranch Market  
The center of suspended commerce: food stalls, forged permits, rail-grease vendors, tool swaps, med-pole tents, and courier recruitment booths.

- Operated loosely by [[Iron Loop]] families and under-the-table [[Ashvial Syndicate]] peddlers  
- Tensions rise when [[Lockjaw Syndicate]] inspectors “audit” public vendor lanes  
- Famous local dish: *"Signal Stew"*—meatless, protein-rich, tastes like old cable but keeps you sharp

---

### ➤ Liftspine 7  
A central support and transit nexus. Still technically active. Key routes for [[Iron Loop]] couriers, inspection personnel, and smuggled riders.

- Contains elevator docks and access lifts into the *Lower Crucible*  
- Officially monitored—unofficially haunted by old permit caches and ghost routes  
- A ritual takes place here weekly: “Clang Blessing” before all major repairs

---

### ➤ Overcross Span  
The longest unbroken platform stretch in the Threadline. Night watchfires burn here. Kids race carts across abandoned lines. Couriers bet on who finishes clean.

- Public hangout zone, informal news exchange, and propaganda board  
- Rumored to have a hidden [[Fracture Union]] checkpoint behind a welded billboard  
- [[Iron Loop]] brass sometimes host “Worker Resilience Briefings” here. Attendance is... strongly encouraged.

## 🧠 Culture & Themes

- **Family through labor.** Most residents trace their lineage to [[Iron Loop]] ancestors who built the rail grid.  
- **Function is sacred.** If it moves, it matters. If it breaks, it’s fixed—or someone bleeds trying.  
- **Gravity is politics.** Threadline dwellers aren’t just up high—they’re between *exploitation* and *collapse*  
- **Union Memory.** Names of fallen freight haulers are carved into the support beams above homes. Sometimes they whisper on bad nights.

## 🔀 Faction Dynamics

- [[Iron Loop]] – Dominant civic and cultural presence; not a police state, but close  
- [[Ashvial Syndicate]] – Quiet operators hiding in courier lanes and permit stalls  
- [[Fracture Union]] – Scattered remnants; seen as both heroes and hazards by locals  
- [[Lockjaw Syndicate]] – Present only as distant eyes—though rumors of “audit proxies” persist

---

## 🎲 Player-Facing Purpose

- **First true urban hub** in [[The Crucible]]—a place to rest, shop, plan, and be seen  
- Introduces **vertical social architecture**: this isn’t just a zone—it’s the *roof you sleep on*  
- Opens **multiple descent paths** to the deeper Crucible infrastructure   
- Ideal setting for **union plots, courier drama, industrial sabotage, or faction recruitment**

---

## 🎯 Encounters & Hooks

- A new “permit surge” hits the district—lines form around [[Liftspine 7]]. [[Ashvial Syndicate]] offers quiet alternatives… for a price.  
- A courier crashes on [[Overcross Span]] carrying a forged rail sigil tied to a player’s name. It wasn’t meant for this tier.  
- A group of freight apprentices invites the PCs to the next “signal bounce” prank—a harmless tradition. But something on the line speaks back.  
- The [[Iron Loop]] posts a bounty for a saboteur hiding in [[Cradlebranch Market]]. One of the vendors slips a note to the PCs: *“Don’t let them find her. She saved my kid.”*
