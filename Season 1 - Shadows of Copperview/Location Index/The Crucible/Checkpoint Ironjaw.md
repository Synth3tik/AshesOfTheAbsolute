## 📷 Description  
Checkpoint Ironjaw is Copperview’s **first real gate**—a fortified, overbuilt bottleneck where the city decides who gets in, who gets stuck, and who disappears. Originally just a transit node, it’s become a **living border-slum**, a place where identity can be bought, lost, or stolen—and where the line is *never just a line*.

**Freight rail gates split the zone**, but the real traffic is foot-bound: smugglers, migrants, deal-brokers, and working-class lifers caught in bureaucratic purgatory.

> "You don’t cross Ironjaw. You survive it."

## 🌆 Streetlife & Atmosphere  

**The queue never moves fast.**  
And when people can’t move, they *sell*.

- **Vendor shacks** choke every available edge: food-on-a-stick, permit “consultants,” counterfeit personality upgrades, grief tattoos for the bored.  
- **News-hawkers** scream half-truths. “Assassination Avoided by Loop’s Bravery!” / “Mirage Priest Sued for Selling Same Name Twice!”  
- **Scam artists** prowl like priests: “You look *so close* to verification. I can help.”  
- **Smugglers whisper** alternate routes for those who don’t mind bleeding—or bribing.

Even the guards are pitched to.  
Especially the guards.

> “You’re gonna be here for six hours. Might as well eat something that screams.”

## 🗺️ Structure  

### ➤ Gate Front  
Massive steel checkpoints—three official, five “shadow” gates. Controlled by [[Iron Loop]] and Lockjaw-sponsored inspectors.

### ➤ Queue Belt  
A half-kilometer of suspended queue ramps, angled metal gangways, and waiting corrals. Families have lived entire months here.

### ➤ Vendor Ridge  
Makeshift market scaffolding hung along the upper walls—home to “queue pirates,” stolen permit auctions, and sermon barkers from half a dozen factions.

### ➤ The Duct Path  
A back-alley network through disused maintenance accessways. Accessed through bribes, favors, or knowing the right tone to hum at a rusted junction box.

## 🧠 Navigation Options

> Ironjaw always offers a way through. But it always costs something.

- **Wait it out** – Bureaucracy grinds eventually. Could be hours. Could be narrative timebombs.  
- **Bribe the Loop** – Station guards accept payments—some want coin, others want *favors*.  
- **Find a Smuggler** – The Ashvial “Courier’s Path” bypasses inspection—but sometimes delivers you somewhere unexpected.  
- **Do a Job** – Solve a vendor's “problem,” retrieve a package from a guarded lift coil, or escort a foreign client. Payment: passage.  
- **Forge it** – Risk a fake ID. Success skips the line. Failure puts your face on a Lockjaw bounty scroll.  
- **Alley Route** – Fracture Union saboteurs know a way through—if you collapse a stairwell behind you.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Notable NPCs

- **[[Sgt. Rask Greel]]** – [[Iron Loop]]  
  Oversees the primary checkpoint. Tired of bribes, but takes them anyway. Thinks like a machine but hates being part of one.

- **[[Ma Slugeye]]** – Independent  
  Elderly noodle vendor and rumor broker with a sixth sense for lies. Knows the queue better than the guards. Her broth is truth-flavored; her dumplings are lies.

- **[[“Tallyhand” Nok]]** – [[Ashvial Syndicate]]  
  Permit fixer and logistical ghost. Offers documentation, courier slips, and "emergency legitimacy" for prices that usually cost more later. Often seen with copper-threaded gloves and an inkstained lanyard.

- **[[Limm the Echo]]** – [[Fracture Union]] (Sympathizer)  
  Duct runner and whisper-hauler. Smuggles information and small packages through forbidden maintenance shafts. Rarely speaks louder than a breath. Claims the city has a voice—he just echoes it.

## 🎲 Encounters & Hooks

- A **riot simmers**—someone’s name was erased from the registry mid-queue. Who flipped the permit?  
- A **news scroll** flashes a party member’s face under “FLAGGED AS STOLEN IDENTITY.”  
- A courier offers **free passage**, then drops dead mid-sentence. His blood spills in the shape of a Coil-Eater glyph.  
- A **Lockjaw “permit auction”** begins—the highest bidder skips the line. Or dies trying.

## 🎭 Player-Facing Use

Ironjaw should **force decision-making** early. It presents:
- A **moral litmus**: do you wait, cheat, fight, or lie?  
- An opportunity to **pick your first ally** (Loop, Ashvial, Fracture, etc.)  
- A way to **establish the vertical pressure** of the city right out of the gate

> “Permits are just promises with ink. You want in, you better make one.”

## 🧂 Local Sayings

> “The city doesn’t start until you’re past Ironjaw. Everything before that is a test.”  
> “You stand still long enough, you become part of the infrastructure.”  
> “If they know your name, it’s already too late.”
